Content and Intellectual Property</h3><h4>4.1. Ownership of Symspace Content</h4><p>Symspace or its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Symspace Content and the overall Symspace Platform.</p><h4>4.2. User Content License</h4><p>By submitting or posting User Content on Symspace, you grant Symspace a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use your content for operating, providing, and promoting the Symspace Platform and Services.</p><h4>4.3. Your Warranties for Content</h4><p>You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the User Content you upload or provide.</p><h4>4.4. Symspace's AI-Generated Content</h4><p>Symspace's AI Tools may generate content such as 3D models, images, descriptions, or chatbot responses based on user inputs.</p><p>More sections can be added based on the complete Terms of Use document.</p><h4>4.4. Symspace’s AI-Generated Content</h4><p>Symspace’s AI Tools may generate content such as 3D models, images, descriptions, or chatbot responses (“AI Outputs”) based on user inputs (e.g., photos, scans, or prompts). You acknowledge that AI Outputs are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind​. While we strive for useful and accurate AI Outputs, these are computer-generated and may not be perfect or fully reliable. AI Outputs might be approximations or interpretations of the input and could include inaccuracies or elements from public data. Symspace does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, or originality of AI-generated content. Users are responsible for reviewing and verifying any AI Outputs before use (for example, a seller should review an AI-generated 3D model or description for their product to ensure it is correct). If you have rights in the input you provided (e.g., you uploaded a photo you own), you retain those rights; the AI Output may be considered a derivative work or new work product to which Symspace may claim rights as the creator of the AI process. Symspace grants you a license to use any AI Output we generate for you, for the purpose it was provided (e.g., a 3D model for you to use or a chatbot answer for your personal information), but you may not use AI Outputs to compete with Symspace or outside the scope of the Services without permission.</p><h4>4.5. Feedback</h4><p>If you provide Symspace with any suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or other feedback about the Platform (“Feedback”), you agree that Symspace is free to use or not use such Feedback for any purpose, without any obligation to you. Any use of Feedback will be without compensation or credit to you and will be owned by Symspace.</p><h4>4.6. Content Moderation</h4><p>Symspace may monitor, screen, remove, or edit User Content at our discretion, but we are not obligated to do so. We may remove or disable content that violates these Terms, infringes intellectual property, is alleged to infringe, or is otherwise objectionable. We may also suspend or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly violate intellectual property rights or these Terms. Symspace assumes no responsibility or liability for any User Content, and you agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage arising from removal of any content or from the failure to remove any content.</p><h4>4.7. Permission for Personal Use</h4><p>You are allowed to access, view, and print Content from the Symspace Platform for your personal and non-commercial use only. For example, a buyer may view 3D models and product information for the purpose of evaluating a purchase, and may use the AR Features to visualize a product in their space for personal use. Except as explicitly permitted, you may not use any part of the Platform or its content for commercial purposes without express permission​. You also may not use Symspace’s trademarks or branding without prior written consent. If you wish to use any content from the Platform beyond what is permitted by these Terms or by law, you must obtain written permission from Symspace or the relevant rights holder.</p><br/><h3>5. Special Terms for AR and AI Features</h3><h4>5.1. Augmented Reality (AR) Features</h4><p>Symspace’s AR features allow you to overlay digital 3D models (such as product images or virtual items) onto your real-world environment through your device’s camera. While we aim to provide true-to-size visualizations to help you see how products fit and look in context​, we do not guarantee that AR representations are perfectly accurate or to scale in all circumstances. Variations in device sensors, user calibration, lighting, and other conditions mean that the size, color, and appearance of products in AR may differ slightly from the actual product. AR visualizations are for informational and illustrative purposes only; they are not a substitute for physically inspecting dimensions or other characteristics. Always double-check critical details (like measurements or colors) through product descriptions or by contacting the seller.</p><h4>5.2. Safety and Awareness</h4><p>When using AR Features, you must exercise caution and remain aware of your surroundings, as hazards may exist in your environment that are not visible through the AR display​. Do not use the AR Features in dangerous locations or situations (for example, near stairs, traffic, or while driving). Symspace is not responsible for any injuries, accidents, or damage that may occur while you are using AR Features. You assume all risk for any such activities. Always ensure you have a safe area to use AR and stop using it if you experience any discomfort (such as dizziness or disorientation) or become aware of a hazard.</p><h4>5.3. Generative AI and Chatbots</h4><p>Symspace may provide AI-driven features like chatbots to answer questions or generative tools to create content (like 3D models or style recommendations). These AI features are experimental and meant to enhance your experience, but they may produce incorrect or unexpected results. For example, a chatbot’s response about a product or an AI-generated style suggestion might not be fully accurate or suitable to your situation. You should not rely solely on AI outputs for important decisions, and you understand that any recommendations or content from AI are provided without any guarantee. Symspace is not responsible for actions you take based on AI-provided information. If you spot an error in an AI output, please let us know so we can improve the system. We reserve the right to modify or restrict the use of AI features at any time.</p><h4>5.4. Third-Party Tools (Unity SDK & Others)</h4><p>Our App integrates the Unity SDK and possibly other third-party AR frameworks (such as ARKit for iOS or ARCore for Android) to power AR experiences. By using our App, you also agree to the necessary third-party software terms to the extent they apply. Symspace has no control over those underlying frameworks. We provide our AR and AI features “as is” and as available, and we disclaim any warranties or liability for issues attributable to third-party components. If the Unity SDK or other third-party service causes a crash or error, we will work to resolve it, but we are not liable for any losses arising from such issues.</p><br/><h2>6. Privacy</h2><p>Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href='#'>Privacy Policy</a> (linked here and incorporated by reference) explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use the Symspace Platform. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Key points include: data we collect (like account info, usage data, AR scan data, cookies), how we use it (to provide and improve services, facilitate transactions, etc.), and how we share it (with sellers for fulfilling orders, with service providers, etc.). Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. If you have questions about our data practices, you can contact us at the information provided in the Privacy Policy.</p><br/><h2>7. Links to Third-Party Sites</h2><p>The Symspace Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources that are not owned or controlled by Symspace (for example, a link to a brand’s site, or an external documentation for Unity or AI services). These links are provided for your convenience only. Symspace does not endorse any third-party sites or their content. You acknowledge that Symspace has no responsibility for the availability, accuracy, or content of such external sites or resources. If you access a third-party website from our Platform, you do so at your own risk, and your use of those sites will be subject to the third party’s terms and policies.</p><br/><h2>8. Affiliate and Partner Disclaimer</h2><p>Symspace works with various affiliate organizations, sponsors, and promotional partners (for example, organizations advocating for accessibility, or technology partners). These entities are collectively included as part of the “Symspace Parties” protected by certain provisions of these Terms. No affiliate or partner of Symspace shall have any liability to users under these Terms. Any claim or dispute arising from your use of the Platform shall only be brought against Symspace, not against its affiliates, shareholders, officers, employees, or partner organizations. You agree that you will not involve Symspace’s affiliates or partners in any legal dispute you may have with Symspace or other users of the Platform.</p><br/><h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2><p><strong>THE SYMSPACE PLATFORM AND ALL CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH IT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND</strong>, either express or implied. Symspace disclaims all warranties, express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Platform and any products or content obtained through the Platform, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, accuracy, or non-infringement.</p><ul><li><strong>Platform Performance:</strong> We do not guarantee that the Symspace Platform will be uninterrupted, secure, or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components.</li><li><strong>Content Accuracy:</strong> Symspace does not warrant that product descriptions, pricing, availability, or other content provided by sellers or other third parties on the Platform are accurate, complete, or reliable.</li><li><strong>AR/AI Outputs:</strong> We make no warranty that AR visualizations or AI Outputs will meet your expectations or requirements.</li><li><strong>Quality of Products:</strong> Symspace is not the manufacturer or provider of the products sold by third-party sellers on the Platform.</li></ul><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such case, our warranties are limited to the minimum scope permitted by law.</p><br/><h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2><p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW</strong>, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF THE SYMSPACE PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.</p><p>Additionally, the total aggregate liability of the Symspace Parties for any claim arising out of these Terms or the Symspace Platform is limited to the greater of:</p><ul><li>The amount you have paid to Symspace in the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the liability.</li><li>USD $100.</li></ul><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages; in those jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.</p><br/><h2>11. Indemnification</h2><p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Symspace and the Symspace Parties from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with:</p><ul><li>Your access to or use of the Symspace Platform.</li><li>Your breach of these Terms.</li><li>Any third-party claim alleging that content you provided infringes intellectual property rights.</li><li>Your violation of any law or the rights of any third party.</li></ul><p>Symspace reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.</p><br/><h2>12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2><h3>12.1. Governing Law</h3><p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p><h3>12.2. Informal Resolution</h3><p>We encourage you to contact us first if you have any issue with Symspace. Often, customer service can resolve most concerns quickly. You can reach us at <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>.</p><h3>12.3. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and Symspace agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis.</p><h3>12.4. Arbitration Procedure</h3><p>The arbitration will be administered by a reputable arbitration organization (such as AAA or JAMS) under its rules for consumer disputes.</p><h3>12.5. Class Action Waiver</h3><p>You and Symspace agree that any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</p><h3>12.6. Opt-Out</h3><p>You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending a written notice to <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.</p><h2>12.7. Exceptions</h2><p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing in these Terms will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such an action may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware or in your resident jurisdiction, at the filing party’s choice.</p><h2>12.8. Jurisdiction and Venue</h2><p>To the extent any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms (for example, if you opt out of arbitration or to enforce an arbitration award or seek injunctive relief), you and Symspace consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. You waive any objections to such jurisdiction or venue, including objections based on inconvenience.</p><br/><h2>13. Termination</h2><h3>13.1. By You</h3><p>You may stop using the Symspace Platform at any time. You may also delete your account by following the instructions on the Platform or contacting customer support. Deleting your account will terminate your ability to log in, but these Terms (and any other agreements you have entered into, such as a Buyer or Seller Agreement) will continue to apply to your past use and any outstanding obligations.</p><h3>13.2. By Symspace</h3><p>We may suspend or terminate your account or your access to all or part of the Platform at any time, with or without notice, for any reason including, but not limited to, if we believe: (a) you have violated these Terms or any other agreement with Symspace; (b) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (c) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such termination or suspension, but we may terminate immediately in some cases (for example, a serious violation or fraud).</p><h3>13.3. Effect of Termination</h3><p>Upon termination of your account, whether by you or us, your right to use the Symspace Platform ceases immediately. However, certain provisions of these Terms will survive termination. These include sections relating to Intellectual Property (Section 4), Disclaimers (Section 9), Limitation of Liability (Section 10), Indemnification (Section 11), Dispute Resolution (Section 12), and any other provision that by its nature should survive termination.</p><h3>13.4. Data on Termination</h3><p>If your account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Content from our Platform, including any 3D models or listing information you provided, without liability to you. However, content that you have made public or shared with others (for example, reviews or comments) may still be accessible by others if it has been cached or re-shared. Symspace is not liable for any damages following account termination, including for loss of data. We recommend that sellers maintain backup copies of any content or data they upload to the Platform.</p><br/><h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2><h3>14.1. Entire Agreement</h3><p>These Terms (together with the Privacy Policy, Buyer Agreement, Seller Agreement, and any additional guidelines or policies posted on the Platform) constitute the entire agreement between you and Symspace regarding your use of the Platform. They supersede any prior agreements or communications between you and us relating to the subject matter. In case of a conflict between these Terms and any other policy or agreement, the specific terms of that policy or agreement will govern with respect to the services or subject matter it addresses (for example, the Seller Agreement will govern matters specific to sellers).</p><h3>14.2. Severability</h3><p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision will be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy the invalidity while preserving the original intent.</p><h3>14.3. No Waiver</h3><p>Symspace’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Symspace.</p><h3>14.4. Assignment</h3><p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment without consent is void. Symspace may freely assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) as part of a corporate reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p><h3>14.5.

        question: "Privacy Policy",
        answer: "<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 21, 2025</p><p>Symspace Labs, Inc. (“Symspace,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you when you use our AI-driven 3D modeling and AR marketplace platform (the “Symspace Platform” or “Services”), how we use and share that information, and your rights and choices regarding your information. This Policy applies to all users of the Symspace Platform, including visitors to our websites and users of our mobile applications.</p><p>By accessing or using Symspace, you agree to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, please do not use the Symspace Platform. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, if we implement new technologies or legal requirements change). We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Policy on our site and updating the “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of the Platform after we make changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.</p><h2>1. Information We Collect</h2><p>We collect information from and about users in a few different ways: information you provide to us, information we collect automatically when you use our Services (including through cookies and similar technologies), and information from third parties.</p><h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3><p><strong>Account and Profile Information:</strong> When you register for a Symspace account or sign up as a buyer or seller, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address, username, password, phone number, and physical address. If you are a seller, we may also collect business information (business name, tax ID, banking details for payouts, etc.). If you choose to provide profile information like a profile photo, display name, or bio, that information is stored by us.</p><p><strong>Transactions and Payment Information:</strong> When you make a purchase through Symspace, we (or our third-party payment processor) collect information to process the payment. This can include your payment method details (such as credit card number, expiration date, billing address) and transaction totals. For security, Symspace itself does not store your full financial account numbers; we use compliant payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal or similar) that handle payment transactions. We will store a record of your purchases, returns, and order history on the Platform. If you are a seller, we collect your payout information (such as bank account or PayPal email) to send you the proceeds of your sales.</p><p><strong>Content and Submissions:</strong> We collect any information or content you submit through the Platform. For example, when you fill out a form, respond to surveys, post a product review, comment or rating, or contact customer support, we collect the information you provide. If you are using our AI-driven 3D modeling features, we collect the input you provide to generate a model (such as photos, descriptions, or scan data). If you participate in contests, promotions, or beta tests, we collect the information needed for those programs (like contest entries or feedback).</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) Scans and Images:</strong> Our mobile app may allow you to scan your environment (room scans, object scans, body measurements, or facial features for try-on) to generate AR visualizations or 3D models. These features might involve capturing images or depth data through your device’s camera. We will collect and process these images or scans only for the purposes of providing the AR functionality (e.g., to show how a piece of furniture fits in your room, or to model clothing on your virtual avatar). In many cases, this processing happens on your device and the data is not uploaded to our servers unless necessary (for instance, if you explicitly save an environment scan or upload images for 3D model generation). We do not use any AR scan data to identify you (unless you explicitly provide identifying information). See Section 2.4 below for more on AR and camera permissions.</p><p><strong>Communications with Us:</strong> If you contact Symspace for support or with inquiries (via email, chat, phone, or through social media), we collect the information you choose to share. This may include your contact information, the content of your messages, and any attachments or screenshots you send.</p><p><strong>Optional Information:</strong> We may also collect information you provide that is not strictly necessary, but offered to enhance your experience. For example, if you fill out a user profile with interests or preferences (like favorite styles, size measurements for clothing try-ons, etc.), we collect that. If you agree to participate in market research or provide testimonials, we collect the information you volunteer. All of this is voluntary.</p><h3>1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h3><p>When you use the Symspace Platform, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of our Services. This includes:</p><p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect data about the device and software you use to access our Services, such as your device’s IP address, device identifiers (like IDFA/GAID or Android ID for mobile apps), device type (e.g., iPhone, Android, PC), operating system and version, browser type and language, and platform. If you use our AR features, we may also collect technical data like your device’s camera resolution, sensors available, or ARKit/ARCore version to ensure compatibility.</p><p><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We log usage data when you access or use the Platform, such as the pages or screens you view, the features you use (e.g., launching the AR viewer, using the AI chatbot), the actions you take (e.g., placing an item in cart, initiating a model generation, or making a purchase), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. We may also collect crash logs or error reports if the app encounters a problem, to help us diagnose and fix issues.</p><p><strong>Location Information:</strong> With your permission, we may collect approximate geolocation information of your device. For example, we might infer your general location (city or country) from your IP address, or if you opt-in on a mobile app, use GPS or other location services to provide location-based features (like showing products or content relevant to your region). You can disable precise location access in your device settings; note that even if you do, we may still derive coarse location from your IP for security and analytics.</p><p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We and our partners use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies on our Sites to collect information and provide certain features. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that help us recognize you on your next visit, understand usage patterns, and personalize content. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences (like language or AR measurement units), and gather analytics about our web traffic. We may also use cookies or pixels in emails to track open rates or whether a link was clicked. See Section 4.1 below for more details on cookies and your choices.</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality Data:</strong> When you use AR Features, in addition to images or scans you provide (covered in 1.1), our app might collect certain sensor data in real-time (like accelerometer, gyroscope, depth sensor readings) to understand your environment and place AR objects. Generally, this sensor data is processed on-device and not stored or transmitted, except as needed to deliver the AR service (for example, a point cloud or mesh might be generated to place a 3D model on a surface, but that data typically stays local and is not sent to our servers unless you explicitly save it or we need to offload processing). We do not collect or store any audio from your microphone during AR use, unless you grant permission for a specific feature that requires audio.</p><p><strong>Logs:</strong> Like many online services, our servers maintain log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The logs may contain data like the IP address of the device, pages visited, actions taken, errors encountered, and possibly device identifiers or user account IDs. We use these logs for security monitoring, debugging, and aggregated analytics.</p><h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3><p>We may receive information about you from third-party sources, but only where those third parties have a legal basis to share your information with us. This might include:</p><p><strong>Third-Party Accounts:</strong> If you choose to register or log in via a third-party account (e.g., Apple Sign-In, Google OAuth, Facebook Login), those services may send us information like your name, email, and profile picture (whatever you authorize under their login process). We use this to create or log you into your account. We do not receive your third-party account password or other sensitive info from those providers.</p><p><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> In some cases, our payment partners may provide us with limited info to confirm transactions. For example, after you make a payment, we might receive a confirmation code or last four digits of your card for record-keeping. If a transaction fails or is suspected fraudulent, we might get a notification.</p><p><strong>Shipping/Logistics Partners:</strong> If a seller or Symspace uses a third-party shipping provider to deliver a product, that provider might share status updates or tracking information with us, which we in turn share with the buyer. In some cases, carriers provide delivery confirmation or issues (like failed delivery attempts) which we keep in order records.</p><p><strong>Analytics or Advertising Partners:</strong> We may receive aggregated demographic or interest information about our user base from analytics companies or advertisers that have collected such information (for example, Google Analytics Demographics reports). This information is de-identified and used to understand our audience at a statistical level (e.g., percentage of users in certain age ranges or interest categories).</p><p><strong>Other Users:</strong> If someone invites you to use Symspace (for example, a friend inviting you to view a shared AR space or a seller inviting you to their storefront), they may provide us with your name and email or other contact information. We only use that information for the purpose of the invitation unless you create an account.</p><p><strong>Public Sources:</strong> We might also gather public information about businesses (for example, verifying a business address or website for a seller) from public databases or websites.</p><p>We treat all such third-party-sourced information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source (for instance, terms of use of a login provider).</p><h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2><p>We use the collected information for various purposes in operating our business and providing our Services to you. These purposes include:</p><h3>2.1 To Provide and Maintain the Services</h3><p>We use your information to operate Symspace and provide you with the features and functionalities of the Platform. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Service:</strong> We use account information to create and maintain your account, authenticate you when you log in, and provide you with your account dashboard, order history, and settings.</li><li><strong>Marketplace Transactions:</strong> We use your information to facilitate transactions. For buyers, we process your orders, facilitate payment through our payment processors, send order confirmations and receipts, and communicate order status updates. For sellers, we list your products, relay orders to you, process your payouts, and provide sales reports.</li><li><strong>3D Modeling & AR:</strong> If you use our AI 3D modeling tools, we use your input to generate the 3D model or content and deliver that output to you. For AR features, we process sensor data to render AR experiences. If you save an AR scene or model, we store it for you.</li><li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use contact information to communicate with you about your account, purchases, and customer support inquiries.</li><li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> If our Platform has social or interactive features, we use your provided data to operate them, such as posting reviews or sharing AR experiences.</li></ul><h3>2.2 To Improve and Develop Our Services</h3><p>We constantly seek to improve Symspace and create new features. We use the information we collect to analyze performance and usage trends to enhance the user experience.</p><p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use usage information and device data to understand how users engage with...</p><h2>2.3 To Personalize Your Experience</h2><p>We want Symspace to be as useful and relevant to you as possible. We may use information to tailor the content and recommendations you see on our Platform:</p><ul><li><strong>Product Recommendations:</strong> Based on your browsing history, purchase history, or preferences, we might suggest products or 3D assets you might like. For instance, if you frequently view AR models of sneakers, we might show you new sneaker releases or related accessories.</li><li><strong>Customized AR content:</strong> If you grant permission for certain data (like your body measurements for virtual try-on, or your room dimensions for furniture placement), we use that to tailor the AR experience specifically to you (e.g., showing only items likely to fit your space).</li><li><strong>Targeted Content:</strong> We may highlight certain sellers or categories on the homepage that we think match your interests, derived from your past activities. We might also adjust the order of search results or feed items to emphasize things more relevant to you.</li><li><strong>Advertising (for our Services):</strong> While we do not sell third-party ads on the platform at this time, we might use your data to present you with Symspace promotional messages or offers. For example, showing you a banner for a feature you haven’t tried (“Check out our new AR makeup try-on”) or emailing you a discount code for items left in your cart. See Section 4.2 on marketing communications for opting out of certain emails.</li><li><strong>Location Customization:</strong> If we know your general location, we might tailor content accordingly (for example, showing region-specific product availability or defaulting to local currency, calculating tax/shipping estimates, or listing local events or promotions).</li></ul><p>Any such personalization uses algorithms that utilize your data. We do not use information like race, religion, or health status for personalization. If we ever implement fully automated decision-making that has a significant effect on you (beyond routine personalization), we will ensure it’s done in compliance with applicable laws and provide you an opportunity to request human review.</p><h2>2.4 To Enable AR and AI Functionality (and Protect Privacy in those contexts)</h2><p>Given the nature of Symspace, special mention is needed for AR and AI features:</p><ul><li><strong>AR Permissions:</strong> The mobile app will request access to certain device features like the camera and possibly motion sensors or LiDAR scanner (if available) to enable AR. We use the camera feed to identify surfaces and render 3D models into your environment in real time. Unless you explicitly capture a photo or video within the app, these camera feeds are not stored on our servers. If you do capture an AR snapshot or record a session and choose to save or upload it, that image/video will be saved to your device and/or uploaded to our server only if you choose to share or save it to your account. We do not scan your camera roll or files – only images you intentionally provide to us are used. You can always disable camera access via your device settings, but then AR features will not function.</li><li><strong>Body/Face Scans:</strong> If we offer a feature to scan your body or face, any such biometric or likeness data is handled with extra care. We will explicitly ask for consent before capturing such data. Typically, these scans create a 3D mesh or map that stays on your device. If any data is uploaded, we will clearly inform you and obtain written consent if required. We do not use biometric data for identification or share it with third parties except as needed to provide the service. We will also provide a means to delete such data if stored on our servers.</li><li><strong>Generative AI Outputs:</strong> For AI-generated content like 3D models or chatbot answers, we use your inputs strictly to generate the result and improve the service. If third-party AI services are used, we ensure they are subject to confidentiality. We also strive to filter out sensitive personal information from being sent to external AI APIs without consent. AI outputs may sometimes be unpredictable; we may review certain outputs to ensure compliance with our policies.</li><li><strong>Unity SDK and Analytics:</strong> The Unity game engine and AR toolkit may collect some data from the app for performance monitoring or analytics and send it to Unity Technologies. Unity may collect device identifiers and usage data to provide aggregated analytics. Unity does not receive your personal account information from us, but they may receive data that could theoretically be linked to you. See Unity’s privacy policy for more. By using our app, you acknowledge these third-party data flows.</li></ul><h2>2.5 To Communicate with You</h2><p>We use your information to send various communications, some required for service, others optional:</p><ul><li><strong>Service and Transactional Communications:</strong> Emails, texts, or app notifications about account activity, order updates, and important service announcements. You cannot opt out of these essential communications.</li><li><strong>Marketing and Promotional Communications:</strong> We may send you newsletters, product recommendations, promotions, or offers. We will obtain any necessary consent required by law. You can opt out via the unsubscribe link or your account preferences.</li><li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> With your consent, the mobile app may send push notifications. You can control these in your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Surveys and Feedback Requests:</strong> Occasionally we might ask for your feedback or survey participation. These are optional and help us improve services.</li><li><strong>Community and Social Features:</strong> If you're part of community features, we might send notifications when someone interacts with you. These can be managed via your account settings.</li></ul><h2>2.6 For Security and Fraud Prevention</h2><p>We are dedicated to keeping Symspace safe. We use information to monitor, detect, and prevent fraud or other illegal activities, and to enforce our terms and policies:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Security:</strong> We monitor login activity and may use CAPTCHA or other tools to ensure security.</li><li><strong>Fraud Monitoring:</strong> We may use algorithms or third-party services to detect suspicious orders or behavior.</li><li><strong>Policy Enforcement:</strong> We use data to investigate violations of our Terms and may remove violating content.</li><li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> In the event of a breach, we may use information to assess the situation and notify users.</li><li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We retain information as needed to comply with legal obligations and public authority requests.</li></ul><h2>2.7 Other Purposes (with Notice or Consent)</h2><p>If we intend to use your personal information for a purpose not described in this Privacy Policy, we will seek your consent or provide appropriate notice. For example, academic research participation or testimonials for marketing would be opt-in only. We will not engage in materially different uses without informing you.</p><h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2><p>Symspace may share your information with third parties in certain circumstances. We do not sell your personal information for third-party marketing. Sharing includes facilitating transactions, working with service providers, and complying with law.</p><h3>3.1 Sharing with Other Users (Buyers and Sellers)</h3><ul><li><strong>Sharing with Sellers:</strong> If you purchase an item from a seller, we share the necessary info to fulfill your order (e.g., name, shipping address, contact info). We don’t share your full payment info. Communications with sellers may also be visible and stored on our platform. Sellers are required to keep buyer info confidential and use it only for order-related purposes.</li><li><strong>Sharing with Buyers:</strong> If you're a seller, certain info (like display name, location, and profile) will be visible to buyers. Buyers may see your seller name and order details. We advise using our messaging tools for communication.</li></ul> <h3>3.3 Sharing with Corporate Affiliates</h3><p>Symspace is currently a single company, but in the future, we may have subsidiaries, affiliates, or may be acquired by or merged with another company. We may share your information within our corporate family or as part of a corporate transaction:</p><h4>Within Our Corporate Group</h4><p>If Symspace Labs, Inc. forms any subsidiaries or affiliated entities (e.g., Symspace International Ltd or a Symspace AR R&D subsidiary), we may share personal information with them to provide services and for internal business operations. These entities will honor this Privacy Policy. For instance, a subsidiary handling EU users would control their data but protect it under this Policy and EU requirements.</p><h4>Business Transfers</h4><p>In the case of a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of company assets, your information may be disclosed or transferred. This includes user statistics and potentially personal data required for continuity. If Symspace is acquired, your data would be transferred to the new owner, who would assume privacy obligations. We will try to notify you of such changes.</p><h4>Affiliated Programs</h4><p>In joint ventures or co-branded offerings (e.g., AR shopping events or academic research), we may share data with affiliates as needed with safeguards and your consent if required. Affiliates here may include third-party partners, distinct from legal corporate affiliates.</p><h3>3.4 Legal Requirements and Protection of Rights</h3><p>We may disclose your information in the following cases:</p><h4>Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4><p>We may share data with government or law enforcement if legally required. For example, responding to subpoenas or search warrants. We will evaluate each request and notify you if allowed and appropriate.</p><h4>Protection of Symspace and Others</h4><ul><li><strong>Prevent Fraud or Crime:</strong> Sharing with law enforcement if illegal activity is detected.</li><li><strong>Enforce Our Terms:</strong> Using or sharing data to enforce terms and investigate violations.</li><li><strong>Address Security Issues:</strong> Disclosing IPs or data to address security or DDoS attacks.</li><li><strong>Debt Collection:</strong> Sharing with agencies or courts to recover owed funds.</li><li><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> Disclosing data if there is immediate danger to someone’s life or safety.</li></ul><p>We balance privacy with legal obligations and community safety. Non-public information is shared only as necessary and legally permitted.</p><h3>3.5 With Your Consent</h3><p>In situations not covered above, we’ll ask for your consent before sharing personal information. Examples:</p><ul><li>Publishing testimonials with your name and picture.</li><li>Joining data-sharing initiatives with opt-in options.</li><li>Opt-in programs with partner brands (e.g., special offers).</li><li>Accessing mobile data like contacts, with OS-level prompts and explanations.</li></ul><p>Any data sharing beyond sections 3.1 to 3.4 will occur only with your approval.</p><h3>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies; Your Choices</h3><h4>4.1 Cookies and Online Tracking</h4><h5>What Are Cookies</h5><p>Cookies are small text files used to make websites function and collect information. Related technologies include web beacons, pixels, localStorage, and SDKs.</p><h5>How We Use Cookies</h5><ul><li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Required for basic site functionality (e.g., sessions, carts).</li><li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> Remember language, currency, and unit preferences.</li><li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Help us understand usage (e.g., via Google Analytics).</li><li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> Enable site features like chat or AR tools.</li><li><strong>Advertising/Retargeting Cookies:</strong> Promote Symspace content or future partner promotions.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Set by services like YouTube embeds or social sharing buttons.</li></ul><h5>Your Choices for Cookies</h5><ul><li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Adjust cookie settings in your browser’s privacy menu.</li><li><strong>Cookie Banner/Tool:</strong> Use our on-site banner to opt in/out of categories (except essential).</li><li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Not currently supported, but cookie preferences are available.</li><li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> App tracking handled via device settings or in-app preferences.</li><li><strong>Google Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> Use <a href=’https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout’ target=’_blank’ rel=’noopener’>this tool</a> to block Google Analytics.</li></ul><p>Disabling cookies may impact your experience (e.g., logging out frequently or broken features).</p><section><h2>4.2 Your Choices and Rights Regarding Your Information</h2><h3>Account Information</h3><p>You can access and update certain personal information from your Symspace account settings at any time. For example, you can edit your profile details, change your email, or update your shipping address. It’s your responsibility to keep your account information current. If you need to change something that’s not editable in your account interface (like a mistake in your birthdate or you want to change your login method), you can contact our support for help.</p><h3>Communication Preferences</h3><ul><li><strong>Marketing Emails:</strong> If you no longer want to receive promotional or newsletter emails from us, you can opt out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of those emails, or by adjusting the email preferences in your account settings. Please note that you will still continue to receive transactional emails (as noted earlier) that are necessary for service (order confirmations, etc.).</li><li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> If you previously consented to receive push notifications on your device, you can turn these off at any time in your device’s settings or in the app’s settings.</li><li><strong>SMS Messages:</strong> If we send SMS/text messages (for things like order updates or 2FA codes) and you wish to opt out of optional texts (not the essential ones like verification codes), you can reply “STOP” to any promotional SMS we send or adjust settings if available. Note that by stopping texts you might miss certain updates, so ensure you have email or app notifications on as an alternative.</li><li><strong>Cookie Choices:</strong> As detailed above, you can control cookies through your browser settings or our site’s cookie consent tools. For mobile app tracking, use device settings as described.</li><li><strong>Do Not Sell/Share (for CCPA etc.):</strong> Symspace does not sell personal information to third parties for monetary consideration. However, if you are in a jurisdiction like California that defines “sale” broadly to include some sharing for advertising, we provide mechanisms to opt out of such sharing. For instance, if we ever share info for targeted advertising considered a “sale” or “share” under California’s CPRA, we will provide a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on our website footer or settings where you can opt out.</li></ul><h3>Access, Correction, Deletion</h3><p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to request access to the personal information Symspace holds about you, to request correction of any inaccuracies, and to request deletion of your personal data. We describe these rights in Section 6 below (Rights of users in certain regions). Even if not mandated by law for all users, we will strive to honor such requests for any user when reasonable (though legal requirements might make us retain some data).</p><p>If you want to delete your account entirely, you can typically do so via an account settings option or by contacting support. When you delete your account, we will deactivate it and remove or anonymize personal data associated with your profile. However, certain information may be retained as required for legal obligations or legitimate business purposes (e.g., records of transactions for accounting, or logs for security as long as needed). Section 7 covers data retention in more detail.</p><h3>Object/Restrict Processing</h3><p>In some jurisdictions (like the EU), you have the right to object to or ask us to restrict processing of your data under certain circumstances – for instance, you might object to processing for direct marketing or some profiling. We definitely respect any objection to marketing: just opt out as above. If you have another objection (say, you want to object to any processing of your usage data for analytics), contact us and we’ll review your request. We might either comply or explain why we need to continue that processing (if allowed by law).</p><h3>Portability</h3><p>Also in some places, you have the right to data portability – meaning you can request an electronic copy of the personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used format. For example, you might want a copy of all your order history and account info. We can provide such exports upon request, within reason.</p><h3>Automated Decision-Making</h3><p>Symspace currently doesn’t make any legally significant decisions about you solely by automated means. If that changes, we would inform you and provide rights to request human review or to contest decisions as required by law.</p><p>To exercise any of your rights or choices, typically you can start by logging into your account settings. If the option isn’t available there, please contact us at <a href=’mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com’>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> or via the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. We may need to verify your identity (for example, by asking you to log in or confirm via email) before fulfilling certain requests, especially for data access or deletion, to ensure it’s really you making the request.</p><p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any privacy rights. However, note that certain choices (like deletion) may limit your ability to use the Service. If you ask us to delete your data but you later sign up again, you may have to re-enter any info needed.</p><h2>4.3 COPPA and Children’s Privacy</h2><p>Symspace is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. In fact, our Terms of Use explicitly prohibit children under 13 from using the Platform, and restrict those between 13 and 17 to only use it with appropriate supervision. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Symspace or send any personal information about yourself to us.</p><h3>Parental Controls</h3><p>If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 (or under the applicable age in your jurisdiction for requiring parental consent), we will take prompt steps to delete that information. For example, if a child manages to create an account and we later find out their age, we will terminate the account and remove associated data. If it's a scenario where a child provided information to us (like contacting support or participating in an AR event), we will similarly purge that data.</p><h3>COPPA Compliance</h3><ul><li>We do not let users under 13 create accounts or participate in commerce on the Platform.</li><li>If we ever introduce any features directed at children or likely to attract users under 13, we will implement COPPA-compliant measures (like parental consent mechanisms). But currently, our content (shopping and AR tools) is aimed at a general audience, not kids.</li><li>Our site might have content that appeals to teens (like AR games or trendy items), but we expect users to be at least 13 and we encourage parents to be aware of their children’s online activities.</li></ul><h3>If You’re a Parent or Guardian</h3><p>If you discover that your child under 13 has created a Symspace account or otherwise provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us immediately at <a =’mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com’>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>. We will delete the information and terminate the child’s account, in accordance with applicable laws.</p><p>For minors who are 13 or older but under 18, we consider those accounts as permitted only with guardian oversight as per our Terms. However, the law (COPPA) mainly addresses under 13. Some regions have similar laws (e.g., under 16 in the EU requires parental consent in some cases). We generally treat under 18 as needing either parental involvement or at least heightened care with data.</p><h3>California Minors</h3><p>If a minor under 18 in California has posted content on our Platform (like a public review or comment) that they later cannot remove via normal means, they can contact us to request removal (California’s “Online Eraser” law). We will then anonymize or remove such content upon verified request.</p><p>In summary, we take children’s privacy seriously and do all we can to avoid collecting data from young children and to protect the data of teens who use our Platform.</p><h2>5. Data Security</h2><p>Symspace implements a range of administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. Nonetheless, here are key security practices we follow:</p><h3>Encryption</h3><p>We use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) encryption for all data transmissions on our Site and App. This means that the data exchanged between your browser/app and our servers is encrypted in transit. We also encrypt sensitive data at rest where appropriate. For example, passwords are hashed (with a strong hashing algorithm and salt) – we never store plaintext passwords. Payment information is handled by third parties as mentioned, but any stored payment tokens on our end are stored securely. For any personal data that is sensitive, we apply encryption or tokenization in databases.</p><h3>Access Controls</h3><p>Our databases and systems are protected by strict access control mechanisms. Only authorized personnel with a need-to-know are allowed access to personal information, and even then, at the minimum level required to perform their job. For example, our customer support may have access to your account information to assist you, but not to your full payment details which they don’t need. We review access privileges regularly and revoke those that are no longer needed.</p><h3>Network Security</h3><p>We maintain firewalls and monitoring systems to protect our network from intrusion. We employ intrusion detection and prevention systems and may use third-party security services to watch for unusual patterns. Our servers are kept up-to-date with security patches to protect against vulnerabilities. We separate environments (e.g., production vs development) to reduce risk. Data backups are made and stored securely (with encryption) to ensure integrity and availability in case of incidents.</p><h3>Testing and Training</h3><p>We conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing by third-party experts, to uncover and fix vulnerabilities. Our development practices include code reviews focusing on security, and we follow industry best practices for secure coding. We also train our staff on cybersecurity and data privacy, emphasizing the importance of protecting user data. Any employee misconduct regarding data handling would result in disciplinary action.</p><h3>Payment Info</h3><p>As noted, we do not store full credit card numbers or sensitive payment info on our servers. Our payment providers are PCI compliant and handle that for us. Any payment data we do store (like last 4 digits, card type, expiration for display, or tokens) is secured.</p><h3>User Responsibilities</h3><p>While we take significant measures, users also play a role in security. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password for Symspace and to keep your login credentials confidential. Do not share your password with others. We also recommend enabling any additional security features we may provide, like two-factor authentication (2FA), if available. Notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.</p><h3>Third-Party Security</h3><p>We carefully vet our third-party service providers for their security practices. For example, our cloud provider has robust security certifications. We include data protection addendums in contracts where appropriate. However, we also rely on their security measures as part of our overall security stance.</p><h3>Incident Response</h3><p>We have an incident response plan in place for handling security breaches. If we suspect or detect a data breach that affects personal information, we will investigate promptly and take remedial actions. Where required by law, we will notify affected users and/or authorities of certain breaches. We aim to be transparent about any significant risks to your data.</p><p>No system is foolproof, but we strive to protect your data as if it were our own sensitive information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with our Platform is no longer secure (for example, if you feel your account has been compromised), please contact us immediately via the contact information below so we can assist.</p><h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR and CCPA and Similar Laws)</h2><p>Depending on where you live, you may have specific privacy rights under local laws. Symspace is committed to honoring applicable data protection laws such as the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), among others. We outline here the rights these laws grant and how you can exercise them:</p><h3>Rights Under GDPR (for users in the European Economic Area, UK, Switzerland, and similar jurisdictions):</h3><ul><li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to obtain information about how we process it​. We will provide a copy in a commonly used electronic form unless otherwise requested.</li><li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If your data is inaccurate or incomplete, you can request a correction.</li><li><strong>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> You can request deletion of your data, subject to legal obligations.</li><li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> You can request a pause on data processing under specific conditions.</li><li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You may request your data in a machine-readable format and transfer it to another provider.</li><li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You may object to data processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing.</li><li><strong>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making:</strong> You may request human intervention in automated decisions, where applicable.</li></ul><p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href=’mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com’>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>. We may verify your identity. Expect a response within 30 days or an explanation of delays if the request is complex.</p><p>If unsatisfied, you may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (e.g., ICO for UK users).</p><h3>Rights Under CCPA/CPRA (for California Residents):</h3><ul><li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> Request the categories and specific personal information collected in the last 12 months.</li><li><strong>Right to Delete:</strong> Request deletion of collected data, subject to exceptions.</li><li><strong>Right to Correct:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate personal information.</li><li><strong>Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing:</strong> We do not sell/share personal data, but opt-out options are provided if we ever do.</li><li><strong>Right to Limit Use of Sensitive PI:</strong> Limit use of sensitive personal info to necessary services only.</li><li><strong>Right of Non-Discrimination:</strong> You will not be treated unfairly for exercising your privacy rights.</li></ul><p>To exercise these rights, email us at <a href=’mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com’>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>. We may request identity verification and aim to respond within 45 days (extendable by another 45 days with notice).</p><h3>Other US State Laws:</h3><p>States like Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have similar privacy rights. Symspace intends to apply comparable rights and processes. We will update our policies as these laws evolve.</p><h3>Authorized Agents:</h3><p>If an agent (e.g., lawyer, privacy service) acts on your behalf, we require signed authorization for privacy requests.</p><h2>7. Data Retention</h2><p>Symspace retains personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Policy, or as required or permitted by law. The duration for which we retain different categories of data can vary depending on the nature of the data and the context in which it was provided. Below, we outline some general retention guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We will keep your account data (like your profile info, login credentials, settings, purchase history) for as long as your account exists because we need it to operate your account. If you choose to delete your account, we will initiate deletion of this data. However, we may retain certain elements for record-keeping as noted below (e.g., orders, legal compliance).</li><li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> We retain records of your transactions (purchases, sales, returns) as these are needed for our accounting and to provide after-sale services (like returns or warranty) and for legal compliance (tax, auditing). Typically, financial and transaction records are kept for at least 7 years or longer if required by local law.</li><li><strong>Communication History:</strong> If you have contacted support or we’ve corresponded with you, we may retain those communications for a period of time. Support emails or chat logs might be kept for a couple of years. Internal communications related to policy violations may be kept indefinitely in minimal form.</li><li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Content you posted (e.g., reviews or comments) may remain until deleted. Upon account deletion, we may anonymize or remove such content depending on its value to other users.</li><li><strong>AR Data and AI Inputs:</strong> We keep AR scans or AI-generated assets only as long as needed to fulfill your request. Raw inputs may be deleted after a buffer period unless saved. Anonymized analytics may be retained longer.</li><li><strong>Cookies & Analytics Data:</strong> Web logs and analytics data are typically retained for 1–3 years. IPs for security analysis may be stored for a few months. Cookies persist based on their designed lifespan.</li><li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We retain data if required for tax/financial compliance, litigation holds, or regulatory purposes such as GDPR or COPPA.</li><li><strong>After Account Deletion:</strong> We strive to remove personal data promptly but backups may persist briefly. Minimal info like hashed email/phone may be retained to prevent abuse.</li><li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> Inactive accounts may eventually be anonymized or deleted after prolonged inactivity (e.g., 5 years), with notice given beforehand.</li><li><strong>Marketing Data:</strong> If subscribed, we retain your email until you opt out. After unsubscribing, your email is retained in a suppression list to prevent accidental re-subscription.</li></ul><p>When we no longer have a legitimate need or legal obligation to retain your personal information, we will securely dispose of it, often via anonymization or deletion. Aggregated, non-identifiable data may be retained indefinitely for analysis.</p><p>If you have specific questions about retention of certain data, you can contact us for more detail.</p><h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2><p>Symspace is based in the United States, but we serve a global user base. Depending on where you are located, your personal information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States or other countries with different data protection laws.</p><h3>Transfers from the EEA/UK/Switzerland:</h3><p>We may transfer personal data to the U.S. and other countries not deemed “adequate” under EU law. However, we implement safeguards such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs):</strong> Approved SCCs bind our partners and processors to privacy protections.</li><li><strong>UK and Swiss Addenda:</strong> We adapt SCCs to meet UK and Swiss legal specifics.</li><li><strong>Data Privacy Framework:</strong> We’re evaluating participation in the U.S.-EU Data Privacy Framework.</li><li><strong>Other Mechanisms:</strong> Some transfers may be required to fulfill contracts or performed with your consent.</li></ul><p>We monitor legal developments and adapt accordingly. Our teams and third parties in countries like Canada or India access data securely under proper transfer mechanisms.</p><p>By using Symspace, you acknowledge your data may be transferred and processed internationally. If you have questions, we can provide more information upon request.</p><h2>9.
