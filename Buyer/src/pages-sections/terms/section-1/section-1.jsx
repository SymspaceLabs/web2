      question: "terms of use", 
      answer:"<h3>Last Updated: March 21, 2025</h3><br/><h3>1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</h3><p>Welcome to Symspace, an AI-driven 3D modeling and augmented reality (AR) marketplace platform. These Terms of Use ('Terms') govern your access to and use of the Symspace websites, mobile applications, Unity SDK components, and related services (collectively, the 'Symspace Platform' or 'Services'). By accessing or using the Symspace Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy, Buyer Agreement, and Seller Agreement (if applicable). If you do not agree, you must not use the Symspace Platform.</p><br/><h3>2.

Use of the Symspace Platform</h3><h4>3.1. Eligibility</h4><p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction) to create an account or use the Services.</p><h4>3.2. Account Registration</h4><p>To access certain features (such as purchasing or selling), you may need to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration.</p><h4>3.3. License to Use</h4><p>Symspace grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Symspace Platform for its intended purposes.</p><h4>3.4. Prohibited Activities</h4><p>You agree NOT to engage in any of the following when using the Symspace Platform:</p><ul><li>Violating Laws: Using the Platform for illegal purposes or in violation of regulations.</li><li>Unauthorized Access: Attempting to access unauthorized accounts or data.</li><li>Interference: Disrupting or interfering with the operation of the Platform.</li><li>Data Scraping: Using bots or automated tools to extract data.</li><li>Inappropriate Content: Uploading unlawful, defamatory, or misleading content.</li></ul><br/><h3>4. Content and Intellectual Property</h3><h4>4.1. Ownership of Symspace Content</h4><p>Symspace or its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Symspace Content and the overall Symspace Platform.</p><h4>4.2. User Content License</h4><p>By submitting or posting User Content on Symspace, you grant Symspace a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use your content for operating, providing, and promoting the Symspace Platform and Services.</p><h4>4.3. Your Warranties for Content</h4><p>You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the User Content you upload or provide.</p><h4>4.4. Symspace's AI-Generated Content</h4><p>Symspace's AI Tools may generate content such as 3D models, images, descriptions, or chatbot responses based on user inputs.</p><p>More sections can be added based on the complete Terms of Use document.</p><h4>4.4. Symspace’s AI-Generated Content</h4><p>Symspace’s AI Tools may generate content such as 3D models, images, descriptions, or chatbot responses (“AI Outputs”) based on user inputs (e.g., photos, scans, or prompts). You acknowledge that AI Outputs are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind​. While we strive for useful and accurate AI Outputs, these are computer-generated and may not be perfect or fully reliable. AI Outputs might be approximations or interpretations of the input and could include inaccuracies or elements from public data. Symspace does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, or originality of AI-generated content. Users are responsible for reviewing and verifying any AI Outputs before use (for example, a seller should review an AI-generated 3D model or description for their product to ensure it is correct). If you have rights in the input you provided (e.g., you uploaded a photo you own), you retain those rights; the AI Output may be considered a derivative work or new work product to which Symspace may claim rights as the creator of the AI process. Symspace grants you a license to use any AI Output we generate for you, for the purpose it was provided (e.g., a 3D model for you to use or a chatbot answer for your personal information), but you may not use AI Outputs to compete with Symspace or outside the scope of the Services without permission.</p><h4>4.5. Feedback</h4><p>If you provide Symspace with any suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or other feedback about the Platform (“Feedback”), you agree that Symspace is free to use or not use such Feedback for any purpose, without any obligation to you. Any use of Feedback will be without compensation or credit to you and will be owned by Symspace.</p><h4>4.6. Content Moderation</h4><p>Symspace may monitor, screen, remove, or edit User Content at our discretion, but we are not obligated to do so. We may remove or disable content that violates these Terms, infringes intellectual property, is alleged to infringe, or is otherwise objectionable. We may also suspend or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly violate intellectual property rights or these Terms. Symspace assumes no responsibility or liability for any User Content, and you agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage arising from removal of any content or from the failure to remove any content.</p><h4>4.7. Permission for Personal Use</h4><p>You are allowed to access, view, and print Content from the Symspace Platform for your personal and non-commercial use only. For example, a buyer may view 3D models and product information for the purpose of evaluating a purchase, and may use the AR Features to visualize a product in their space for personal use. Except as explicitly permitted, you may not use any part of the Platform or its content for commercial purposes without express permission​. You also may not use Symspace’s trademarks or branding without prior written consent. If you wish to use any content from the Platform beyond what is permitted by these Terms or by law, you must obtain written permission from Symspace or the relevant rights holder.</p><br/><h3>5. Special Terms for AR and AI Features</h3><h4>5.1. Augmented Reality (AR) Features</h4><p>Symspace’s AR features allow you to overlay digital 3D models (such as product images or virtual items) onto your real-world environment through your device’s camera. While we aim to provide true-to-size visualizations to help you see how products fit and look in context​, we do not guarantee that AR representations are perfectly accurate or to scale in all circumstances. Variations in device sensors, user calibration, lighting, and other conditions mean that the size, color, and appearance of products in AR may differ slightly from the actual product. AR visualizations are for informational and illustrative purposes only; they are not a substitute for physically inspecting dimensions or other characteristics. Always double-check critical details (like measurements or colors) through product descriptions or by contacting the seller.</p><h4>5.2. Safety and Awareness</h4><p>When using AR Features, you must exercise caution and remain aware of your surroundings, as hazards may exist in your environment that are not visible through the AR display​. Do not use the AR Features in dangerous locations or situations (for example, near stairs, traffic, or while driving). Symspace is not responsible for any injuries, accidents, or damage that may occur while you are using AR Features. You assume all risk for any such activities. Always ensure you have a safe area to use AR and stop using it if you experience any discomfort (such as dizziness or disorientation) or become aware of a hazard.</p><h4>5.3. Generative AI and Chatbots</h4><p>Symspace may provide AI-driven features like chatbots to answer questions or generative tools to create content (like 3D models or style recommendations). These AI features are experimental and meant to enhance your experience, but they may produce incorrect or unexpected results. For example, a chatbot’s response about a product or an AI-generated style suggestion might not be fully accurate or suitable to your situation. You should not rely solely on AI outputs for important decisions, and you understand that any recommendations or content from AI are provided without any guarantee. Symspace is not responsible for actions you take based on AI-provided information. If you spot an error in an AI output, please let us know so we can improve the system. We reserve the right to modify or restrict the use of AI features at any time.</p><h4>5.4. Third-Party Tools (Unity SDK & Others)</h4><p>Our App integrates the Unity SDK and possibly other third-party AR frameworks (such as ARKit for iOS or ARCore for Android) to power AR experiences. By using our App, you also agree to the necessary third-party software terms to the extent they apply. Symspace has no control over those underlying frameworks. We provide our AR and AI features “as is” and as available, and we disclaim any warranties or liability for issues attributable to third-party components. If the Unity SDK or other third-party service causes a crash or error, we will work to resolve it, but we are not liable for any losses arising from such issues.</p><br/><h2>6. Privacy</h2><p>Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href='#'>Privacy Policy</a> (linked here and incorporated by reference) explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use the Symspace Platform. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Key points include: data we collect (like account info, usage data, AR scan data, cookies), how we use it (to provide and improve services, facilitate transactions, etc.), and how we share it (with sellers for fulfilling orders, with service providers, etc.). Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. If you have questions about our data practices, you can contact us at the information provided in the Privacy Policy.</p><br/><h2>7. Links to Third-Party Sites</h2><p>The Symspace Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources that are not owned or controlled by Symspace (for example, a link to a brand’s site, or an external documentation for Unity or AI services). These links are provided for your convenience only. Symspace does not endorse any third-party sites or their content. You acknowledge that Symspace has no responsibility for the availability, accuracy, or content of such external sites or resources. If you access a third-party website from our Platform, you do so at your own risk, and your use of those sites will be subject to the third party’s terms and policies.</p><br/><h2>8. Affiliate and Partner Disclaimer</h2><p>Symspace works with various affiliate organizations, sponsors, and promotional partners (for example, organizations advocating for accessibility, or technology partners). These entities are collectively included as part of the “Symspace Parties” protected by certain provisions of these Terms. No affiliate or partner of Symspace shall have any liability to users under these Terms. Any claim or dispute arising from your use of the Platform shall only be brought against Symspace, not against its affiliates, shareholders, officers, employees, or partner organizations. You agree that you will not involve Symspace’s affiliates or partners in any legal dispute you may have with Symspace or other users of the Platform.</p><br/><h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2><p><strong>THE SYMSPACE PLATFORM AND ALL CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH IT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND</strong>, either express or implied. Symspace disclaims all warranties, express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Platform and any products or content obtained through the Platform, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, accuracy, or non-infringement.</p><ul><li><strong>Platform Performance:</strong> We do not guarantee that the Symspace Platform will be uninterrupted, secure, or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components.</li><li><strong>Content Accuracy:</strong> Symspace does not warrant that product descriptions, pricing, availability, or other content provided by sellers or other third parties on the Platform are accurate, complete, or reliable.</li><li><strong>AR/AI Outputs:</strong> We make no warranty that AR visualizations or AI Outputs will meet your expectations or requirements.</li><li><strong>Quality of Products:</strong> Symspace is not the manufacturer or provider of the products sold by third-party sellers on the Platform.</li></ul><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such case, our warranties are limited to the minimum scope permitted by law.</p><br/><h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2><p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW</strong>, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF THE SYMSPACE PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.</p><p>Additionally, the total aggregate liability of the Symspace Parties for any claim arising out of these Terms or the Symspace Platform is limited to the greater of:</p><ul><li>The amount you have paid to Symspace in the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the liability.</li><li>USD $100.</li></ul><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages; in those jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.</p><br/><h2>11. Indemnification</h2><p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Symspace and the Symspace Parties from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with:</p><ul><li>Your access to or use of the Symspace Platform.</li><li>Your breach of these Terms.</li><li>Any third-party claim alleging that content you provided infringes intellectual property rights.</li><li>Your violation of any law or the rights of any third party.</li></ul><p>Symspace reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.</p><br/><h2>12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2><h3>12.1. Governing Law</h3><p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p><h3>12.2. Informal Resolution</h3><p>We encourage you to contact us first if you have any issue with Symspace. Often, customer service can resolve most concerns quickly. You can reach us at <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>.</p><h3>12.3. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and Symspace agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis.</p><h3>12.4. Arbitration Procedure</h3><p>The arbitration will be administered by a reputable arbitration organization (such as AAA or JAMS) under its rules for consumer disputes.</p><h3>12.5. Class Action Waiver</h3><p>You and Symspace agree that any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</p><h3>12.6. Opt-Out</h3><p>You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending a written notice to <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.</p><h2>12.7. Exceptions</h2><p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing in these Terms will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such an action may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware or in your resident jurisdiction, at the filing party’s choice.</p><h2>12.8. Jurisdiction and Venue</h2><p>To the extent any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms (for example, if you opt out of arbitration or to enforce an arbitration award or seek injunctive relief), you and Symspace consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. You waive any objections to such jurisdiction or venue, including objections based on inconvenience.</p><br/><h2>13. Termination</h2><h3>13.1. By You</h3><p>You may stop using the Symspace Platform at any time. You may also delete your account by following the instructions on the Platform or contacting customer support. Deleting your account will terminate your ability to log in, but these Terms (and any other agreements you have entered into, such as a Buyer or Seller Agreement) will continue to apply to your past use and any outstanding obligations.</p><h3>13.2. By Symspace</h3><p>We may suspend or terminate your account or your access to all or part of the Platform at any time, with or without notice, for any reason including, but not limited to, if we believe: (a) you have violated these Terms or any other agreement with Symspace; (b) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (c) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such termination or suspension, but we may terminate immediately in some cases (for example, a serious violation or fraud).</p><h3>13.3. Effect of Termination</h3><p>Upon termination of your account, whether by you or us, your right to use the Symspace Platform ceases immediately. However, certain provisions of these Terms will survive termination. These include sections relating to Intellectual Property (Section 4), Disclaimers (Section 9), Limitation of Liability (Section 10), Indemnification (Section 11), Dispute Resolution (Section 12), and any other provision that by its nature should survive termination.</p><h3>13.4. Data on Termination</h3><p>If your account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Content from our Platform, including any 3D models or listing information you provided, without liability to you. However, content that you have made public or shared with others (for example, reviews or comments) may still be accessible by others if it has been cached or re-shared. Symspace is not liable for any damages following account termination, including for loss of data. We recommend that sellers maintain backup copies of any content or data they upload to the Platform.</p><br/><h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2><h3>14.1. Entire Agreement</h3><p>These Terms (together with the Privacy Policy, Buyer Agreement, Seller Agreement, and any additional guidelines or policies posted on the Platform) constitute the entire agreement between you and Symspace regarding your use of the Platform. They supersede any prior agreements or communications between you and us relating to the subject matter. In case of a conflict between these Terms and any other policy or agreement, the specific terms of that policy or agreement will govern with respect to the services or subject matter it addresses (for example, the Seller Agreement will govern matters specific to sellers).</p><h3>14.2. Severability</h3><p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision will be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy the invalidity while preserving the original intent.</p><h3>14.3. No Waiver</h3><p>Symspace’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Symspace.</p><h3>14.4. Assignment</h3><p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment without consent is void. Symspace may freely assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) as part of a corporate reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p><h3>14.5. No Agency</h3><p>No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Symspace as a result of these Terms or your use of the Platform. You do not have any authority to bind Symspace in any respect.</p><h3>14.6. Notices</h3><p>Symspace may provide notices to you by email to the address associated with your account, by postal mail, or via postings on the Platform. Notices will be deemed given as of the date they are sent or posted. You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date. You may provide notices to Symspace by email at <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> or by written communication to Symspace Labs, Inc., [address].</p><h3>14.7. Force Majeure</h3><p>Symspace will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms because of any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, governmental actions, internet or utility failures, or any other cause beyond our control.</p><p>By using the Symspace Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Use. Thank you for using Symspace!</p>",

      question: "Privacy Policy",
      answer: "<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 21, 2025</p><p>Symspace Labs, Inc. (“Symspace,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) values your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you when you use our AI-driven 3D modeling and AR marketplace platform (the “Symspace Platform” or “Services”), how we use and share that information, and your rights and choices regarding your information. This Policy applies to all users of the Symspace Platform, including visitors to our websites and users of our mobile applications.</p><p>By accessing or using Symspace, you agree to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our practices, please do not use the Symspace Platform. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time (for example, if we implement new technologies or legal requirements change). We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Policy on our site and updating the “Last Updated” date. Your continued use of the Platform after we make changes indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.</p><h2>1. Information We Collect</h2><p>We collect information from and about users in a few different ways: information you provide to us, information we collect automatically when you use our Services (including through cookies and similar technologies), and information from third parties.</p><h3>1.1 Information You Provide to Us</h3><p><strong>Account and Profile Information:</strong> When you register for a Symspace account or sign up as a buyer or seller, we may collect personal information such as your name, email address, username, password, phone number, and physical address. If you are a seller, we may also collect business information (business name, tax ID, banking details for payouts, etc.). If you choose to provide profile information like a profile photo, display name, or bio, that information is stored by us.</p><p><strong>Transactions and Payment Information:</strong> When you make a purchase through Symspace, we (or our third-party payment processor) collect information to process the payment. This can include your payment method details (such as credit card number, expiration date, billing address) and transaction totals. For security, Symspace itself does not store your full financial account numbers; we use compliant payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal or similar) that handle payment transactions. We will store a record of your purchases, returns, and order history on the Platform. If you are a seller, we collect your payout information (such as bank account or PayPal email) to send you the proceeds of your sales.</p><p><strong>Content and Submissions:</strong> We collect any information or content you submit through the Platform. For example, when you fill out a form, respond to surveys, post a product review, comment or rating, or contact customer support, we collect the information you provide. If you are using our AI-driven 3D modeling features, we collect the input you provide to generate a model (such as photos, descriptions, or scan data). If you participate in contests, promotions, or beta tests, we collect the information needed for those programs (like contest entries or feedback).</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR) Scans and Images:</strong> Our mobile app may allow you to scan your environment (room scans, object scans, body measurements, or facial features for try-on) to generate AR visualizations or 3D models. These features might involve capturing images or depth data through your device’s camera. We will collect and process these images or scans only for the purposes of providing the AR functionality (e.g., to show how a piece of furniture fits in your room, or to model clothing on your virtual avatar). In many cases, this processing happens on your device and the data is not uploaded to our servers unless necessary (for instance, if you explicitly save an environment scan or upload images for 3D model generation). We do not use any AR scan data to identify you (unless you explicitly provide identifying information). See Section 2.4 below for more on AR and camera permissions.</p><p><strong>Communications with Us:</strong> If you contact Symspace for support or with inquiries (via email, chat, phone, or through social media), we collect the information you choose to share. This may include your contact information, the content of your messages, and any attachments or screenshots you send.</p><p><strong>Optional Information:</strong> We may also collect information you provide that is not strictly necessary, but offered to enhance your experience. For example, if you fill out a user profile with interests or preferences (like favorite styles, size measurements for clothing try-ons, etc.), we collect that. If you agree to participate in market research or provide testimonials, we collect the information you volunteer. All of this is voluntary.</p><h3>1.2 Information We Collect Automatically</h3><p>When you use the Symspace Platform, we automatically collect certain information about your device and usage of our Services. This includes:</p><p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect data about the device and software you use to access our Services, such as your device’s IP address, device identifiers (like IDFA/GAID or Android ID for mobile apps), device type (e.g., iPhone, Android, PC), operating system and version, browser type and language, and platform. If you use our AR features, we may also collect technical data like your device’s camera resolution, sensors available, or ARKit/ARCore version to ensure compatibility.</p><p><strong>Usage Information:</strong> We log usage data when you access or use the Platform, such as the pages or screens you view, the features you use (e.g., launching the AR viewer, using the AI chatbot), the actions you take (e.g., placing an item in cart, initiating a model generation, or making a purchase), and the time, frequency, and duration of your activities. We may also collect crash logs or error reports if the app encounters a problem, to help us diagnose and fix issues.</p><p><strong>Location Information:</strong> With your permission, we may collect approximate geolocation information of your device. For example, we might infer your general location (city or country) from your IP address, or if you opt-in on a mobile app, use GPS or other location services to provide location-based features (like showing products or content relevant to your region). You can disable precise location access in your device settings; note that even if you do, we may still derive coarse location from your IP for security and analytics.</p><p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We and our partners use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies on our Sites to collect information and provide certain features. Cookies are small text files placed on your device that help us recognize you on your next visit, understand usage patterns, and personalize content. For example, we use cookies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences (like language or AR measurement units), and gather analytics about our web traffic. We may also use cookies or pixels in emails to track open rates or whether a link was clicked. See Section 4.1 below for more details on cookies and your choices.</p><p><strong>Augmented Reality Data:</strong> When you use AR Features, in addition to images or scans you provide (covered in 1.1), our app might collect certain sensor data in real-time (like accelerometer, gyroscope, depth sensor readings) to understand your environment and place AR objects. Generally, this sensor data is processed on-device and not stored or transmitted, except as needed to deliver the AR service (for example, a point cloud or mesh might be generated to place a 3D model on a surface, but that data typically stays local and is not sent to our servers unless you explicitly save it or we need to offload processing). We do not collect or store any audio from your microphone during AR use, unless you grant permission for a specific feature that requires audio.</p><p><strong>Logs:</strong> Like many online services, our servers maintain log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The logs may contain data like the IP address of the device, pages visited, actions taken, errors encountered, and possibly device identifiers or user account IDs. We use these logs for security monitoring, debugging, and aggregated analytics.</p><h3>1.3 Information from Third Parties</h3><p>We may receive information about you from third-party sources, but only where those third parties have a legal basis to share your information with us. This might include:</p><p><strong>Third-Party Accounts:</strong> If you choose to register or log in via a third-party account (e.g., Apple Sign-In, Google OAuth, Facebook Login), those services may send us information like your name, email, and profile picture (whatever you authorize under their login process). We use this to create or log you into your account. We do not receive your third-party account password or other sensitive info from those providers.</p><p><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> In some cases, our payment partners may provide us with limited info to confirm transactions. For example, after you make a payment, we might receive a confirmation code or last four digits of your card for record-keeping. If a transaction fails or is suspected fraudulent, we might get a notification.</p><p><strong>Shipping/Logistics Partners:</strong> If a seller or Symspace uses a third-party shipping provider to deliver a product, that provider might share status updates or tracking information with us, which we in turn share with the buyer. In some cases, carriers provide delivery confirmation or issues (like failed delivery attempts) which we keep in order records.</p><p><strong>Analytics or Advertising Partners:</strong> We may receive aggregated demographic or interest information about our user base from analytics companies or advertisers that have collected such information (for example, Google Analytics Demographics reports). This information is de-identified and used to understand our audience at a statistical level (e.g., percentage of users in certain age ranges or interest categories).</p><p><strong>Other Users:</strong> If someone invites you to use Symspace (for example, a friend inviting you to view a shared AR space or a seller inviting you to their storefront), they may provide us with your name and email or other contact information. We only use that information for the purpose of the invitation unless you create an account.</p><p><strong>Public Sources:</strong> We might also gather public information about businesses (for example, verifying a business address or website for a seller) from public databases or websites.</p><p>We treat all such third-party-sourced information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source (for instance, terms of use of a login provider).</p><h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2><p>We use the collected information for various purposes in operating our business and providing our Services to you. These purposes include:</p><h3>2.1 To Provide and Maintain the Services</h3><p>We use your information to operate Symspace and provide you with the features and functionalities of the Platform. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Service:</strong> We use account information to create and maintain your account, authenticate you when you log in, and provide you with your account dashboard, order history, and settings.</li><li><strong>Marketplace Transactions:</strong> We use your information to facilitate transactions. For buyers, we process your orders, facilitate payment through our payment processors, send order confirmations and receipts, and communicate order status updates. For sellers, we list your products, relay orders to you, process your payouts, and provide sales reports.</li><li><strong>3D Modeling & AR:</strong> If you use our AI 3D modeling tools, we use your input to generate the 3D model or content and deliver that output to you. For AR features, we process sensor data to render AR experiences. If you save an AR scene or model, we store it for you.</li><li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use contact information to communicate with you about your account, purchases, and customer support inquiries.</li><li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> If our Platform has social or interactive features, we use your provided data to operate them, such as posting reviews or sharing AR experiences.</li></ul><h3>2.2 To Improve and Develop Our Services</h3><p>We constantly seek to improve Symspace and create new features. We use the information we collect to analyze performance and usage trends to enhance the user experience.</p><p><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use usage information and device data to understand how users engage with...</p><h2>2.3 To Personalize Your Experience</h2><p>We want Symspace to be as useful and relevant to you as possible. We may use information to tailor the content and recommendations you see on our Platform:</p><ul><li><strong>Product Recommendations:</strong> Based on your browsing history, purchase history, or preferences, we might suggest products or 3D assets you might like. For instance, if you frequently view AR models of sneakers, we might show you new sneaker releases or related accessories.</li><li><strong>Customized AR content:</strong> If you grant permission for certain data (like your body measurements for virtual try-on, or your room dimensions for furniture placement), we use that to tailor the AR experience specifically to you (e.g., showing only items likely to fit your space).</li><li><strong>Targeted Content:</strong> We may highlight certain sellers or categories on the homepage that we think match your interests, derived from your past activities. We might also adjust the order of search results or feed items to emphasize things more relevant to you.</li><li><strong>Advertising (for our Services):</strong> While we do not sell third-party ads on the platform at this time, we might use your data to present you with Symspace promotional messages or offers. For example, showing you a banner for a feature you haven’t tried (“Check out our new AR makeup try-on”) or emailing you a discount code for items left in your cart. See Section 4.2 on marketing communications for opting out of certain emails.</li><li><strong>Location Customization:</strong> If we know your general location, we might tailor content accordingly (for example, showing region-specific product availability or defaulting to local currency, calculating tax/shipping estimates, or listing local events or promotions).</li></ul><p>Any such personalization uses algorithms that utilize your data. We do not use information like race, religion, or health status for personalization. If we ever implement fully automated decision-making that has a significant effect on you (beyond routine personalization), we will ensure it’s done in compliance with applicable laws and provide you an opportunity to request human review.</p><h2>2.4 To Enable AR and AI Functionality (and Protect Privacy in those contexts)</h2><p>Given the nature of Symspace, special mention is needed for AR and AI features:</p><ul><li><strong>AR Permissions:</strong> The mobile app will request access to certain device features like the camera and possibly motion sensors or LiDAR scanner (if available) to enable AR. We use the camera feed to identify surfaces and render 3D models into your environment in real time. Unless you explicitly capture a photo or video within the app, these camera feeds are not stored on our servers. If you do capture an AR snapshot or record a session and choose to save or upload it, that image/video will be saved to your device and/or uploaded to our server only if you choose to share or save it to your account. We do not scan your camera roll or files – only images you intentionally provide to us are used. You can always disable camera access via your device settings, but then AR features will not function.</li><li><strong>Body/Face Scans:</strong> If we offer a feature to scan your body or face, any such biometric or likeness data is handled with extra care. We will explicitly ask for consent before capturing such data. Typically, these scans create a 3D mesh or map that stays on your device. If any data is uploaded, we will clearly inform you and obtain written consent if required. We do not use biometric data for identification or share it with third parties except as needed to provide the service. We will also provide a means to delete such data if stored on our servers.</li><li><strong>Generative AI Outputs:</strong> For AI-generated content like 3D models or chatbot answers, we use your inputs strictly to generate the result and improve the service. If third-party AI services are used, we ensure they are subject to confidentiality. We also strive to filter out sensitive personal information from being sent to external AI APIs without consent. AI outputs may sometimes be unpredictable; we may review certain outputs to ensure compliance with our policies.</li><li><strong>Unity SDK and Analytics:</strong> The Unity game engine and AR toolkit may collect some data from the app for performance monitoring or analytics and send it to Unity Technologies. Unity may collect device identifiers and usage data to provide aggregated analytics. Unity does not receive your personal account information from us, but they may receive data that could theoretically be linked to you. See Unity’s privacy policy for more. By using our app, you acknowledge these third-party data flows.</li></ul><h2>2.5 To Communicate with You</h2><p>We use your information to send various communications, some required for service, others optional:</p><ul><li><strong>Service and Transactional Communications:</strong> Emails, texts, or app notifications about account activity, order updates, and important service announcements. You cannot opt out of these essential communications.</li><li><strong>Marketing and Promotional Communications:</strong> We may send you newsletters, product recommendations, promotions, or offers. We will obtain any necessary consent required by law. You can opt out via the unsubscribe link or your account preferences.</li><li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> With your consent, the mobile app may send push notifications. You can control these in your device’s settings.</li><li><strong>Surveys and Feedback Requests:</strong> Occasionally we might ask for your feedback or survey participation. These are optional and help us improve services.</li><li><strong>Community and Social Features:</strong> If you're part of community features, we might send notifications when someone interacts with you. These can be managed via your account settings.</li></ul><h2>2.6 For Security and Fraud Prevention</h2><p>We are dedicated to keeping Symspace safe. We use information to monitor, detect, and prevent fraud or other illegal activities, and to enforce our terms and policies:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Security:</strong> We monitor login activity and may use CAPTCHA or other tools to ensure security.</li><li><strong>Fraud Monitoring:</strong> We may use algorithms or third-party services to detect suspicious orders or behavior.</li><li><strong>Policy Enforcement:</strong> We use data to investigate violations of our Terms and may remove violating content.</li><li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> In the event of a breach, we may use information to assess the situation and notify users.</li><li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> We retain information as needed to comply with legal obligations and public authority requests.</li></ul><h2>2.7 Other Purposes (with Notice or Consent)</h2><p>If we intend to use your personal information for a purpose not described in this Privacy Policy, we will seek your consent or provide appropriate notice. For example, academic research participation or testimonials for marketing would be opt-in only. We will not engage in materially different uses without informing you.</p><h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2><p>Symspace may share your information with third parties in certain circumstances. We do not sell your personal information for third-party marketing. Sharing includes facilitating transactions, working with service providers, and complying with law.</p><h3>3.1 Sharing with Other Users (Buyers and Sellers)</h3><ul><li><strong>Sharing with Sellers:</strong> If you purchase an item from a seller, we share the necessary info to fulfill your order (e.g., name, shipping address, contact info). We don’t share your full payment info. Communications with sellers may also be visible and stored on our platform. Sellers are required to keep buyer info confidential and use it only for order-related purposes.</li><li><strong>Sharing with Buyers:</strong> If you're a seller, certain info (like display name, location, and profile) will be visible to buyers. Buyers may see your seller name and order details. We advise using our messaging tools for communication.</li></ul> <h3>3.3 Sharing with Corporate Affiliates</h3><p>Symspace is currently a single company, but in the future, we may have subsidiaries, affiliates, or may be acquired by or merged with another company. We may share your information within our corporate family or as part of a corporate transaction:</p><h4>Within Our Corporate Group</h4><p>If Symspace Labs, Inc. forms any subsidiaries or affiliated entities (e.g., Symspace International Ltd or a Symspace AR R&D subsidiary), we may share personal information with them to provide services and for internal business operations. These entities will honor this Privacy Policy. For instance, a subsidiary handling EU users would control their data but protect it under this Policy and EU requirements.</p><h4>Business Transfers</h4><p>In the case of a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of company assets, your information may be disclosed or transferred. This includes user statistics and potentially personal data required for continuity. If Symspace is acquired, your data would be transferred to the new owner, who would assume privacy obligations. We will try to notify you of such changes.</p><h4>Affiliated Programs</h4><p>In joint ventures or co-branded offerings (e.g., AR shopping events or academic research), we may share data with affiliates as needed with safeguards and your consent if required. Affiliates here may include third-party partners, distinct from legal corporate affiliates.</p><h3>3.4 Legal Requirements and Protection of Rights</h3><p>We may disclose your information in the following cases:</p><h4>Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4><p>We may share data with government or law enforcement if legally required. For example, responding to subpoenas or search warrants. We will evaluate each request and notify you if allowed and appropriate.</p><h4>Protection of Symspace and Others</h4><ul><li><strong>Prevent Fraud or Crime:</strong> Sharing with law enforcement if illegal activity is detected.</li><li><strong>Enforce Our Terms:</strong> Using or sharing data to enforce terms and investigate violations.</li><li><strong>Address Security Issues:</strong> Disclosing IPs or data to address security or DDoS attacks.</li><li><strong>Debt Collection:</strong> Sharing with agencies or courts to recover owed funds.</li><li><strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> Disclosing data if there is immediate danger to someone’s life or safety.</li></ul><p>We balance privacy with legal obligations and community safety. Non-public information is shared only as necessary and legally permitted.</p><h3>3.5 With Your Consent</h3><p>In situations not covered above, we’ll ask for your consent before sharing personal information. Examples:</p><ul><li>Publishing testimonials with your name and picture.</li><li>Joining data-sharing initiatives with opt-in options.</li><li>Opt-in programs with partner brands (e.g., special offers).</li><li>Accessing mobile data like contacts, with OS-level prompts and explanations.</li></ul><p>Any data sharing beyond sections 3.1 to 3.4 will occur only with your approval.</p><h3>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies; Your Choices</h3><h4>4.1 Cookies and Online Tracking</h4><h5>What Are Cookies</h5><p>Cookies are small text files used to make websites function and collect information. Related technologies include web beacons, pixels, localStorage, and SDKs.</p><h5>How We Use Cookies</h5><ul><li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Required for basic site functionality (e.g., sessions, carts).</li><li><strong>Preference Cookies:</strong> Remember language, currency, and unit preferences.</li><li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Help us understand usage (e.g., via Google Analytics).</li><li><strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> Enable site features like chat or AR tools.</li><li><strong>Advertising/Retargeting Cookies:</strong> Promote Symspace content or future partner promotions.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Set by services like YouTube embeds or social sharing buttons.</li></ul><h5>Your Choices for Cookies</h5><ul><li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Adjust cookie settings in your browser’s privacy menu.</li><li><strong>Cookie Banner/Tool:</strong> Use our on-site banner to opt in/out of categories (except essential).</li><li><strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Not currently supported, but cookie preferences are available.</li><li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> App tracking handled via device settings or in-app preferences.</li><li><strong>Google Analytics Opt-Out:</strong> Use <a href=’https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout’ target=’_blank’ rel=’noopener’>this tool</a> to block Google Analytics.</li></ul><p>Disabling cookies may impact your experience (e.g., logging out frequently or broken features).</p><h2>4.2 Your Choices and Rights Regarding Your Information</h2><h3>Account Information</h3><p>You can access and update certain personal information from your Symspace account settings at any time. For example, you can edit your profile details, change your email, or update your shipping address. It’s your responsibility to keep your account information current. If you need to change something that’s not editable in your account interface (like a mistake in your birthdate or you want to change your login method), you can contact our support for help.</p><h3>Communication Preferences</h3><ul><li><strong>Marketing Emails:</strong> If you no longer want to receive promotional or newsletter emails from us, you can opt out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of those emails, or by adjusting the email preferences in your account settings. Please note that you will still continue to receive transactional emails (as noted earlier) that are necessary for service (order confirmations, etc.).</li><li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> If you previously consented to receive push notifications on your device, you can turn these off at any time in your device’s settings or in the app’s settings.</li><li><strong>SMS Messages:</strong> If we send SMS/text messages (for things like order updates or 2FA codes) and you wish to opt out of optional texts (not the essential ones like verification codes), you can reply “STOP” to any promotional SMS we send or adjust settings if available. Note that by stopping texts you might miss certain updates, so ensure you have email or app notifications on as an alternative.</li><li><strong>Cookie Choices:</strong> As detailed above, you can control cookies through your browser settings or our site’s cookie consent tools. For mobile app tracking, use device settings as described.</li><li><strong>Do Not Sell/Share (for CCPA etc.):</strong> Symspace does not sell personal information to third parties for monetary consideration. However, if you are in a jurisdiction like California that defines “sale” broadly to include some sharing for advertising, we provide mechanisms to opt out of such sharing. For instance, if we ever share info for targeted advertising considered a “sale” or “share” under California’s CPRA, we will provide a “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” link on our website footer or settings where you can opt out.</li></ul><h3>Access, Correction, Deletion</h3><p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to request access to the personal information Symspace holds about you, to request correction of any inaccuracies, and to request deletion of your personal data. We describe these rights in Section 6 below (Rights of users in certain regions). Even if not mandated by law for all users, we will strive to honor such requests for any user when reasonable (though legal requirements might make us retain some data).</p><p>If you want to delete your account entirely, you can typically do so via an account settings option or by contacting support. When you delete your account, we will deactivate it and remove or anonymize personal data associated with your profile. However, certain information may be retained as required for legal obligations or legitimate business purposes (e.g., records of transactions for accounting, or logs for security as long as needed). Section 7 covers data retention in more detail.</p><h3>Object/Restrict Processing</h3><p>In some jurisdictions (like the EU), you have the right to object to or ask us to restrict processing of your data under certain circumstances – for instance, you might object to processing for direct marketing or some profiling. We definitely respect any objection to marketing: just opt out as above. If you have another objection (say, you want to object to any processing of your usage data for analytics), contact us and we’ll review your request. We might either comply or explain why we need to continue that processing (if allowed by law).</p><h3>Portability</h3><p>Also in some places, you have the right to data portability – meaning you can request an electronic copy of the personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used format. For example, you might want a copy of all your order history and account info. We can provide such exports upon request, within reason.</p><h3>Automated Decision-Making</h3><p>Symspace currently doesn’t make any legally significant decisions about you solely by automated means. If that changes, we would inform you and provide rights to request human review or to contest decisions as required by law.</p><p>To exercise any of your rights or choices, typically you can start by logging into your account settings. If the option isn’t available there, please contact us at <a href=’mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com’>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> or via the contact details provided at the end of this Privacy Policy. We may need to verify your identity (for example, by asking you to log in or confirm via email) before fulfilling certain requests, especially for data access or deletion, to ensure it’s really you making the request.</p><p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any privacy rights. However, note that certain choices (like deletion) may limit your ability to use the Service. If you ask us to delete your data but you later sign up again, you may have to re-enter any info needed.</p><h2>4.3 COPPA and Children’s Privacy</h2><p>Symspace is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. In fact, our Terms of Use explicitly prohibit children under 13 from using the Platform, and restrict those between 13 and 17 to only use it with appropriate supervision. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for Symspace or send any personal information about yourself to us.</p><h3>Parental Controls</h3><p>If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13 (or under the applicable age in your jurisdiction for requiring parental consent), we will take prompt steps to delete that information. For example, if a child manages to create an account and we later find out their age, we will terminate the account and remove associated data. If it's a scenario where a child provided information to us (like contacting support or participating in an AR event), we will similarly purge that data.</p><h3>COPPA Compliance</h3><ul><li>We do not let users under 13 create accounts or participate in commerce on the Platform.</li><li>If we ever introduce any features directed at children or likely to attract users under 13, we will implement COPPA-compliant measures (like parental consent mechanisms). But currently, our content (shopping and AR tools) is aimed at a general audience, not kids.</li><li>Our site might have content that appeals to teens (like AR games or trendy items), but we expect users to be at least 13 and we encourage parents to be aware of their children’s online activities.</li></ul><h3>If You’re a Parent or Guardian</h3><p>If you discover that your child under 13 has created a Symspace account or otherwise provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us immediately at <a =’mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com’>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>. We will delete the information and terminate the child’s account, in accordance with applicable laws.</p><p>For minors who are 13 or older but under 18, we consider those accounts as permitted only with guardian oversight as per our Terms. However, the law (COPPA) mainly addresses under 13. Some regions have similar laws (e.g., under 16 in the EU requires parental consent in some cases). We generally treat under 18 as needing either parental involvement or at least heightened care with data.</p><h3>California Minors</h3><p>If a minor under 18 in California has posted content on our Platform (like a public review or comment) that they later cannot remove via normal means, they can contact us to request removal (California’s “Online Eraser” law). We will then anonymize or remove such content upon verified request.</p><p>In summary, we take children’s privacy seriously and do all we can to avoid collecting data from young children and to protect the data of teens who use our Platform.</p><h2>5. Data Security</h2><p>Symspace implements a range of administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security. Nonetheless, here are key security practices we follow:</p><h3>Encryption</h3><p>We use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) encryption for all data transmissions on our Site and App. This means that the data exchanged between your browser/app and our servers is encrypted in transit. We also encrypt sensitive data at rest where appropriate. For example, passwords are hashed (with a strong hashing algorithm and salt) – we never store plaintext passwords. Payment information is handled by third parties as mentioned, but any stored payment tokens on our end are stored securely. For any personal data that is sensitive, we apply encryption or tokenization in databases.</p><h3>Access Controls</h3><p>Our databases and systems are protected by strict access control mechanisms. Only authorized personnel with a need-to-know are allowed access to personal information, and even then, at the minimum level required to perform their job. For example, our customer support may have access to your account information to assist you, but not to your full payment details which they don’t need. We review access privileges regularly and revoke those that are no longer needed.</p><h3>Network Security</h3><p>We maintain firewalls and monitoring systems to protect our network from intrusion. We employ intrusion detection and prevention systems and may use third-party security services to watch for unusual patterns. Our servers are kept up-to-date with security patches to protect against vulnerabilities. We separate environments (e.g., production vs development) to reduce risk. Data backups are made and stored securely (with encryption) to ensure integrity and availability in case of incidents.</p><h3>Testing and Training</h3><p>We conduct regular security assessments, including penetration testing by third-party experts, to uncover and fix vulnerabilities. Our development practices include code reviews focusing on security, and we follow industry best practices for secure coding. We also train our staff on cybersecurity and data privacy, emphasizing the importance of protecting user data. Any employee misconduct regarding data handling would result in disciplinary action.</p><h3>Payment Info</h3><p>As noted, we do not store full credit card numbers or sensitive payment info on our servers. Our payment providers are PCI compliant and handle that for us. Any payment data we do store (like last 4 digits, card type, expiration for display, or tokens) is secured.</p><h3>User Responsibilities</h3><p>While we take significant measures, users also play a role in security. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password for Symspace and to keep your login credentials confidential. Do not share your password with others. We also recommend enabling any additional security features we may provide, like two-factor authentication (2FA), if available. Notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.</p><h3>Third-Party Security</h3><p>We carefully vet our third-party service providers for their security practices. For example, our cloud provider has robust security certifications. We include data protection addendums in contracts where appropriate. However, we also rely on their security measures as part of our overall security stance.</p><h3>Incident Response</h3><p>We have an incident response plan in place for handling security breaches. If we suspect or detect a data breach that affects personal information, we will investigate promptly and take remedial actions. Where required by law, we will notify affected users and/or authorities of certain breaches. We aim to be transparent about any significant risks to your data.</p><p>No system is foolproof, but we strive to protect your data as if it were our own sensitive information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with our Platform is no longer secure (for example, if you feel your account has been compromised), please contact us immediately via the contact information below so we can assist.</p><h2>6. Your Rights (GDPR and CCPA and Similar Laws)</h2><p>Depending on where you live, you may have specific privacy rights under local laws. Symspace is committed to honoring applicable data protection laws such as the EU/UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), among others.

We may request identity verification and aim to respond within 45 days (extendable by another 45 days with notice).</p><h3>Other US State Laws:</h3><p>States like Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have similar privacy rights. Symspace intends to apply comparable rights and processes. We will update our policies as these laws evolve.</p><h3>Authorized Agents:</h3><p>If an agent (e.g., lawyer, privacy service) acts on your behalf, we require signed authorization for privacy requests.</p><h2>7. Data Retention</h2><p>Symspace retains personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this Privacy Policy, or as required or permitted by law. The duration for which we retain different categories of data can vary depending on the nature of the data and the context in which it was provided. Below, we outline some general retention guidelines:</p><ul><li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We will keep your account data (like your profile info, login credentials, settings, purchase history) for as long as your account exists because we need it to operate your account. If you choose to delete your account, we will initiate deletion of this data. However, we may retain certain elements for record-keeping as noted below (e.g., orders, legal compliance).</li><li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> We retain records of your transactions (purchases, sales, returns) as these are needed for our accounting and to provide after-sale services (like returns or warranty) and for legal compliance (tax, auditing). Typically, financial and transaction records are kept for at least 7 years or longer if required by local law.</li><li><strong>Communication History:</strong> If you have contacted support or we’ve corresponded with you, we may retain those communications for a period of time. Support emails or chat logs might be kept for a couple of years. Internal communications related to policy violations may be kept indefinitely in minimal form.</li><li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Content you posted (e.g., reviews or comments) may remain until deleted. Upon account deletion, we may anonymize or remove such content depending on its value to other users.</li><li><strong>AR Data and AI Inputs:</strong> We keep AR scans or AI-generated assets only as long as needed to fulfill your request. Raw inputs may be deleted after a buffer period unless saved. Anonymized analytics may be retained longer.</li><li><strong>Cookies & Analytics Data:</strong> Web logs and analytics data are typically retained for 1–3 years. IPs for security analysis may be stored for a few months. Cookies persist based on their designed lifespan.</li><li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We retain data if required for tax/financial compliance, litigation holds, or regulatory purposes such as GDPR or COPPA.</li><li><strong>After Account Deletion:</strong> We strive to remove personal data promptly but backups may persist briefly. Minimal info like hashed email/phone may be retained to prevent abuse.</li><li><strong>Inactive Accounts:</strong> Inactive accounts may eventually be anonymized or deleted after prolonged inactivity (e.g., 5 years), with notice given beforehand.</li><li><strong>Marketing Data:</strong> If subscribed, we retain your email until you opt out. After unsubscribing, your email is retained in a suppression list to prevent accidental re-subscription.</li></ul><p>When we no longer have a legitimate need or legal obligation to retain your personal information, we will securely dispose of it, often via anonymization or deletion. Aggregated, non-identifiable data may be retained indefinitely for analysis.</p><p>If you have specific questions about retention of certain data, you can contact us for more detail.</p><h2>8.

      question: "Buyer Terms & Conditions",
      answer: "<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 21, 2025</p><p>Welcome to Symspace! This Buyer Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions specifically applicable to buyers (“Buyer” or “you”) who use the Symspace Platform to purchase products or services. By creating a Symspace account or making a purchase through Symspace’s websites or apps, you agree to this Buyer Agreement, as well as the general Terms of Use (which govern overall use of the Platform) and the Privacy Policy. In the event of any conflict between this Buyer Agreement and the Terms of Use, this Buyer Agreement will govern with respect to buyer-specific terms.</p><p>Please read this Agreement carefully before making any purchases on Symspace. It contains important information about your rights and obligations as a buyer, including conditions of purchase, returns, and limitations of liability. If you do not agree to these terms, do not make purchases on the Platform.</p><h2>1. Symspace Marketplace Role</h2><h3>1.1. Marketplace Platform</h3><p>Symspace provides an online marketplace and AR platform that enables third-party sellers (“Sellers”) to list and sell their products, and buyers to discover and purchase those products. Symspace itself is generally not the seller of the items listed by third-party Sellers, unless an item is expressly indicated as being sold by Symspace. When you purchase an item from a third-party Seller on Symspace, the contract of sale is between you and the Seller, not directly with Symspace​. Symspace’s role is to facilitate the transaction by providing the Platform, processing payments on behalf of the Seller, and offering services like customer support and dispute resolution as described in this Agreement.</p><h3>1.2. Seller of Record</h3><p>The Seller (the person or business listing the product) is the “seller of record” responsible for fulfilling your order, providing the product, and handling any warranty or return obligations, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. Symspace is not a party to the sales contract between you and the Seller, and Symspace does not transfer legal ownership of products from Sellers to Buyers. Title and risk of loss for the product pass from the Seller to you upon physical delivery of the item to you (or to a carrier for shipment to you, depending on shipping terms), except as otherwise specified by law.</p><h3>1.3. Symspace as Limited Agent</h3><p>By placing an order on Symspace, you authorize Symspace to act as your agent to convey your order to the Seller, and to act as the Seller’s agent to accept payment from you on the Seller’s behalf. Symspace will charge your selected payment method for the full amount of the order (product price, applicable taxes, shipping fees, etc.), and upon successful charge, Symspace will notify the Seller to fulfill the order. Symspace’s receipt of your payment completes your payment obligation to the Seller. In other words, when you pay Symspace, you have effectively paid the Seller, and any failure by Symspace to remit that payment to the Seller will not affect the Seller’s obligation to deliver the product​.</p><h3>1.4. Future Symspace Sales</h3><p>Symspace may in the future sell products directly (for example, Symspace-branded items or products we source and stock). If you purchase a product where Symspace is listed as the Seller (clearly indicated on the product listing), Symspace will be the seller of record and will assume the responsibilities of Seller under this Agreement for that transaction. All terms herein still apply, except that Symspace will also have the obligations of a Seller. Symspace’s direct sales will be clearly distinguished on the Platform. (For instance, a listing might say “Sold by Symspace” or be under a Symspace storefront).</p><h3>1.5. Affiliate Partners</h3><p>Symspace works with certain affiliate or promotional partners (such as organizations that help bring users to the Platform). These partners are not Sellers and are not parties to transactions. They have no obligations to you in the purchase process; their role is simply referral or co-marketing. They are, however, protected by certain disclaimers and liability limits as noted in the Terms of Use (they are included in “Symspace Parties” for purposes of protection). You agree that such partners have no liability concerning your purchases, and any issues will be handled between you, the Seller, and Symspace.</p><h2>2. Purchasing on Symspace</h2><h3>2.1. Account Requirement</h3><p>To make a purchase, you will generally need a Symspace account in good standing. Ensure that your account information (shipping address, email, etc.) is accurate and up-to-date before placing an order. Orders may not be processed if information is incomplete or fraudulent. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account login, and any activity under your account (including orders placed) will be presumed to be authorized by you.</p><h3>2.2. Product Listings</h3><p>Product descriptions, prices, availability, and other listing information are provided by the Sellers. Symspace is not the author of these listings (unless it’s a Symspace direct sale). We require Sellers to provide accurate and complete information about their products​, including key details, images, and any terms specific to that product (like warranty or return policy if different from the norm). However, we do not guarantee that the listing content is error-free, complete, or current. Minor differences may exist between the 3D model or images in AR and the actual product (color tone, minor design updates, etc.). If you notice a significant discrepancy, you should contact the Seller or Symspace support before purchase.</p><h3>2.3. Prices and Taxes</h3><p>All prices are listed in the currency indicated (e.g., USD for United States, etc.). Prices do not include applicable sales, use, VAT, or other taxes unless explicitly stated. At checkout, any applicable taxes and shipping fees will be calculated and added. We strive to display the correct price for each item, but in case of a pricing error (for instance, if an item is listed far below its intended price due to a mistake), the Seller or Symspace may cancel the order before shipment (see Order Acceptance below). If a pricing error is obvious and unmistakable, and could have reasonably been recognized by you as a mispricing, neither the Seller nor Symspace is obligated to provide the product at that incorrect price.</p><h3>2.4. Placing an Order</h3><p>When you find a product you wish to buy, add it to your cart and proceed through the checkout process. You will be asked to provide payment information and confirm your shipping address and contact info. By clicking the “Place Order” (or similar) button, you are committing to buy the selected items and authorizing the charge to your payment method. Your Order is an offer to purchase the product(s) from the Seller. The Seller (or Symspace on the Seller’s behalf) must then accept your offer.</p><h3>2.5. Order Confirmation and Acceptance</h3><p>After you place an order, Symspace will acknowledge receipt with an order confirmation number and summary, usually via email. This order confirmation is not yet acceptance of your order, but a confirmation that it was received. The contract of sale between you and the Seller is not final until the Seller accepts and dispatches the product. Typically, acceptance occurs when the order is shipped out to you, at which point Symspace will send you a shipment confirmation email (or in-app notification). In many cases, the contract is formed when Symspace (on behalf of the Seller) charges your payment method and confirms the item is preparing for shipment​. Sellers are expected to maintain inventory accuracy, but if by chance the item is unavailable or a price error is detected, the Seller or Symspace may cancel the order (see Section 2.6). If you ordered multiple items from potentially multiple Sellers, each item may constitute a separate acceptance as they are shipped.</p><h3>2.6. Cancellation of Orders by Symspace/Seller</h3><p>There may be circumstances where an order cannot be accepted or must be canceled after acceptance. Symspace and Sellers reserve the right to cancel any order for any reason prior to delivery. Some common reasons include:</p><ul><li>The product is out of stock or discontinued (and was not updated on the listing in time).</li><li>Pricing or product description errors (including obvious AR visualization mistakes of the product).</li><li>Payment issues: if the payment is declined or flagged by our fraud systems, the order won’t be processed.</li><li>Shipping or regulatory limitations.</li><li>Suspected fraud or unauthorized transaction.</li><li>Misuse or abuse (e.g., exceeding any stated purchase limits).</li></ul><p>If your order is canceled, you will be notified and any payment captured will be refunded. Symspace is not liable for losses due to order cancellation beyond refunding what you paid.</p><h3>2.7. Buyer-Initiated Cancellations</h3><p>If you change your mind shortly after placing an order, you may attempt to cancel it through the Platform within the cancellation window. The ability to cancel depends on the order status and each Seller’s policies. If cancellation is possible, you’ll get a prompt refund. If not, you may need to wait for delivery and then process a return. Digital products or services may not be cancelable if delivery started.</p><h2>3. Payment Terms</h2><h3>3.1. Payment Processing</h3><p>Symspace (or its designated payment processor) will charge your provided payment method at the time of order placement (or, in some cases, at time of shipment). By providing a payment method, you represent that you are authorized to use that method and you authorize Symspace (or its payment agents) to charge the full amount of your order.</p><h3>3.2. Payment Methods</h3><p>We accept various payment methods such as credit/debit cards, PayPal, Symspace gift cards or credits, and others. Availability may depend on your location. You agree to provide current and accurate billing info. If your payment fails, the order may be canceled.</p><h3>3.3. Intermediary Role of Symspace</h3><p>Symspace collects payment as an agent for the Seller. The charge may appear as “Symspace” on your statement. Symspace holds the funds and disburses to the Seller under conditions outlined in the agreement.</p><h3>3.4. Pricing Currency and Conversion</h3><p>Prices might be displayed in your local currency based on exchange rates. Symspace is not responsible for bank conversion fees or rate discrepancies.</p><h3>3.5. Taxes</h3><p>Buyers are responsible for taxes. Symspace will collect and remit tax where required. The applicable amount will be shown at checkout. If you're tax-exempt, provide valid documentation before purchase.</p><p><strong>3.6. Symspace Credits or Gift Cards:</strong> If you have Symspace-issued credits, coupons, or gift cards, you can apply them at checkout according to their terms. They may have expiration dates or usage limits. Credits are not redeemable for cash (unless required by law) and if used on a purchase that is later refunded, the refund may be reissued as credit.</p><p><strong>3.7. Failed Charges and Collections:</strong> If your payment method is declined, we’ll notify you and the order won’t be processed until you provide a valid payment. If you somehow received a product without a successful charge (for instance, a later chargeback or reversal), you agree to pay the amount due upon notice. We reserve the right to pursue unpaid amounts including via collection agencies or legal claims, and you may be responsible for any costs of collection (like attorney fees) as allowed by law. We may also limit or terminate your account until the issue is resolved.</p><p><strong>3.8. Refunds:</strong> Refunds, when issued (for returns, cancellations, or other adjustments), will generally be processed back to the original payment method. Timing for refunds can vary – typically 5-10 business days after approval of refund, depending on bank/card processing times. If original payment method is not available (e.g., expired card), we may issue refund via alternate means (like store credit or contacting you for different refund method). Any Symspace fees that were part of purchase (like a protection plan) will be refunded only if the entire order is refunded or if required. See Returns section for more.</p><h3>4. Shipping and Delivery</h3><p><strong>4.1. Shipping of Products:</strong> Sellers are responsible for shipping the products you purchase to the address you specify, unless otherwise noted (in some cases Symspace or a fulfillment partner may handle shipping for Sellers). During checkout, you’ll select from available shipping options (standard, expedited, etc.) with associated costs. The shipping times provided (e.g., “3-5 business days”) are estimates and not guarantees, though Sellers strive to meet them.</p><p><strong>4.2. Address Accuracy:</strong> You are responsible for providing a correct and complete shipping address. Double-check your address at checkout. Neither Symspace nor the Seller is liable for delays or non-delivery if the address provided was incorrect or incomplete. If a package is returned due to address issues, we will contact you to get the correct address and you may be charged additional shipping fees to re-send.</p><p><strong>4.3. International Orders:</strong> If you order from a Seller in a different country, be aware of potential import duties, customs fees, or brokerage charges that may apply when the package enters your country. You are responsible for any such additional import costs unless the listing explicitly states that those fees are included or covered by the Seller. Customs clearance can cause delays beyond original delivery estimates, which are not within Symspace’s or the Seller’s control. Ensure the items you order can be legally imported to your country. We will not be responsible if customs seizes an item that is prohibited in your region (though Sellers are expected not to list globally any item not allowable).</p><p><strong>4.4. Delivery and Risk of Loss:</strong> Deliveries will be made by third-party carriers (postal services, UPS/FedEx, DHL, etc.) to the address provided. Once the Seller hands over the product to the carrier, risk of loss passes to you, the Buyer (unless otherwise stated by law; for example, some jurisdictions keep risk with seller until delivered). That means if a package is lost in transit, we will of course work with you and the carrier to locate or remedy it, but ultimately the carrier’s liability and insurance (if any) would govern. We often insure or require signature for high-value shipments for your protection. If tracking shows delivered but you did not receive the item, please check with household members/neighbors and notify Symspace/Seller quickly. We may assist with filing a carrier claim or investigating, but note the complexity in “porch theft” scenarios. We recommend being available or using secure delivery options for expensive items.</p><p><strong>4.5. Delay or Failure to Deliver:</strong> Most orders arrive within the expected timeframe. If your order is significantly delayed, you will be notified if possible. You have the right to cancel an order that has not shipped within any timeframe promised at purchase. If the Seller fails to ship in a timely manner (typically we expect sellers to ship within 2-3 business days unless longer handling was stated), you can contact us and we can cancel/refund if appropriate. If a package is lost or never arrives, Symspace will either refund you or ensure a replacement is sent, after a reasonable investigation period (often after the carrier deems it lost). Symspace is not liable for any indirect costs due to late delivery (like if you needed an item for an event and it arrived late, we’re sorry but we don’t cover incidental damages). We only will refund the purchase price and shipping if an item never arrives or is returned due to failure to deliver.</p><p><strong>4.6. Multiple Shipments:</strong> If you order multiple items, they might be from different Sellers and therefore will ship separately and possibly on different dates. Shipping fees are usually applied per item or per seller shipment (we might combine or discount if items can ship together, but often they cannot if different sellers). Your order detail page will show each item’s status and tracking if available.</p><p><strong>4.7. Inspection on Delivery:</strong> We highly recommend that you inspect the package and item upon delivery. If there’s obvious damage to the package, take photos before opening if possible and check the item’s condition. If the product itself is damaged or something is wrong, notify the Seller or Symspace within 5 business days of delivery so we can address it as a “DOA” (dead on arrival) or damaged shipment claim. After that window, it’s harder to establish that damage occurred in transit versus after delivery. This does not limit your return rights, but it helps expedite resolution.</p><h2>5. Returns, Refunds, and Disputes</h2><h3>5.1. Return Policy Overview:</h3><p>Symspace wants you to be satisfied with your purchases. Most physical products purchased on Symspace can be returned within a set timeframe if they meet the return conditions. Unless a specific listing says otherwise (e.g., “Final Sale” or a seller’s custom return policy), the standard return window is 30 days from the date of delivery to initiate a return. This means you should contact Symspace/Seller or use the return function within 30 days after you received the item. Some categories of products may have different return periods or conditions (for instance, electronics might have a shorter window if opened, or apparel might require tags attached, etc.). We will clearly indicate in the product listing or at checkout if a product is not returnable or has special terms.</p><h3>5.2. Return Conditions:</h3><p>To be eligible for a refund, returned items should generally be in the same condition that you received them, with all original packaging, tags, and accessories. For example, if you buy a pair of AR glasses, you should return them with the case, charger, manuals, etc. intact. Some reasonable use is expected if you tried the product, but excessive wear, damage, or missing components may result in a restocking fee or denial of refund. Certain items may not be returnable if opened due to health/hygiene reasons (e.g., personal care items, earbuds) unless they were defective. Software or digital goods, once delivered, are typically not returnable. If an item was sold as “New” and you’ve registered it or used it significantly, the Seller might charge a restocking fee (commonly 10-20%) or refuse the return if the value is significantly diminished, unless the return is due to defect or error.</p><h3>5.3. Process for Returns:</h3><p>To initiate a return, log into your account, go to your orders, and click “Request Return” (or similar) for the item. Provide a reason for return to help us process it (like “didn’t fit,” “changed mind,” “item not as described,” etc.). The Symspace system will either provide you with an RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) number and instructions, or the Seller/Symspace will contact you with next steps. In many cases, you will receive a return shipping label (especially if the return is due to a defect or our error, that label may be prepaid; for buyer’s remorse returns, return shipping might be at your cost, depending on policy). Pack the item securely and drop it off with the carrier indicated.</p><h3>5.4. Cost of Returns:</h3><p>If the return is due to a Symspace or Seller error (wrong item sent, item defective or damaged upon arrival, etc.), you will not be charged return shipping and you’ll receive a full refund (plus original shipping).</p><p>If the return is buyer-initiated for convenience (you changed your mind, ordered the wrong thing, etc.), you may be responsible for return shipping costs. We might deduct a return label fee from your refund if we provided a label, or you might pay for postage yourself. Original shipping fees may not be refunded in this case. Some Sellers might charge a small restocking fee for non-defective returns; if so, it should have been stated in the listing or at least we’ll inform you during the return process. (We aim to avoid surprise fees, so we encourage Sellers to be transparent. If none was disclosed, we generally don’t allow a fee beyond shipping.)</p><h4>AR Visualization Disclaimer:</h4><p>Note that AR representation differences (e.g., color slightly off, size looked different on your phone) are generally not considered “item not as described” misrepresentation by the Seller; those fall under change of mind unless it was a drastic difference. We encourage you to read product dimensions and details in addition to using AR. That said, if the AR was grossly wrong (e.g., model looked like a chair but product was a table), obviously that’s an error scenario and we’d treat it as a reason for free return.</p><h3>5.5. Refund Process:</h3><p>Once the returned item is received by the Seller (or Symspace’s returns center, if we coordinate returns) and inspected, the refund will be processed. This typically takes 5-7 business days after the item arrives back, to allow time for inspection. We will then issue the refund to your original payment method (or to Symspace credit if you prefer or if original method is unavailable). You will receive an email confirmation of the refund. If any deductions were made (for shipping or restocking as per policy), those will be outlined. If the item returned is not in the expected condition (for example, missing parts or clearly used beyond what’s acceptable), we will contact you with options (partial refund or sending the item back to you). Symspace will mediate to ensure fairness.</p><h3>5.6. Exceptions – Non-Returnable Items:</h3><p>Some items cannot be returned. Common examples: digital downloads or codes that have been delivered, perishable goods, personalized/custom-made items (unless they arrive damaged or not as agreed), intimate or sanitary goods once opened, hazardous materials, etc. Additionally, any item marked “Final Sale” at the time of purchase is not eligible for return or refund except for defects. If a product is sold during a clearance or special sale with no returns, that will be indicated. By purchasing such an item, you accept that the sale is final.</p><h3>5.7. Item Not as Described / Incorrect Items:</h3><p>If you receive an item that is materially different from its description or a completely wrong item, that’s on the Seller. You should notify us within the return window (or as soon as discovered). We will likely provide a prepaid return label for you to send it back (or in some cases, we may not require a return if the item is low value or not worth returning) and you can choose a full refund or possibly a replacement if the Seller has the correct item still available. Symspace will ensure you are not out-of-pocket for return shipping in such cases. Please provide photos or details of the discrepancy; this helps us take action with the Seller (and it’s evidence if a dispute arises).</p><h3>5.8. Damaged or Defective Products:</h3><p>If the product arrives damaged or becomes defective soon after delivery (for example, it malfunctions on first use), inform us within the 30-day window (the sooner the better). Depending on the product, we may either process it as a return/refund or assist you in a warranty claim (if applicable). Many electronic items come with manufacturer warranties beyond our return period; in such cases, after 30 days, you may need to contact the manufacturer for repair/replacement under warranty, but within 30 days, we generally handle it. You may be asked to describe the issue and perhaps troubleshoot or provide photos. If confirmed defective, the solution could be a replacement (if stock available) or a refund. Return shipping will be covered for defects.</p><h3>5.9. Disputes with Sellers / Symspace Buyer Protection:</h3><p>In the event you encounter a problem with an order — e.g., you didn’t receive the item, or the Seller is unresponsive to a return request, or disagrees about a refund — Symspace’s customer support is here to help. We call this Symspace Buyer Protection. If you have tried to resolve with the Seller and it’s not resolved (or immediately if you prefer), you can escalate the issue to Symspace. We will investigate the transaction, communications, tracking info, etc., and make a determination. Symspace may issue a refund or other appropriate resolution at our discretion. For example, if an item is lost in mail and Seller didn’t insure or require signature for an expensive item, we might side with you and refund. Conversely, if tracking shows delivered and we see evidence of correct address and perhaps even delivery photo, and you claim non-receipt, we’ll work with you but might not refund if we suspect theft outside our control (we’d advise filing a police report or homeowners insurance claim in that case, while we assist minimally). We aim to be fair and consider both Buyer and Seller positions. Our decision in such disputes is final for purposes of reimbursement, but doesn’t waive either party’s legal rights (you could still legally pursue the seller and vice versa, but typically our resolution stands in practice).</p><h3>5.10. Chargebacks:</h3><p>We encourage you to avoid filing a chargeback with your bank or credit card without first contacting us. We are often able to resolve any issues faster and more amicably. If you dispute a charge directly with your bank (chargeback), it will slow things down as we have to provide information to the bank. If we have refunded you already through our process, disputing with the bank again could result in double refunds which will eventually be corrected. If you do file a chargeback, we reserve the right to dispute it if we believe it’s unjustified (providing proof of delivery, etc.). Filing false or abusive chargebacks can lead to account termination. That said, we respect your rights to dispute fraudulent charges—just know we’re here to help and often a direct resolution is simpler.</p><h2>6. Buyer Conduct and Use of Platform</h2><h3>6.1. Personal Use Only</h3><p>Purchases on Symspace by Buyers are generally for personal or gift use. You agree not to purchase products on Symspace for the purpose of reselling them in a commercial capacity (i.e., you’re not acting as a retailer sourcing inventory via our consumer platform). If we suspect bulk purchases for resale (for example, buying 10 units of a limited item under different accounts), we may cancel orders or limit quantities. We may also impose limits per customer for certain high-demand items.</p><h3>6.2. Prohibited Activities</h3><p>As a Buyer on Symspace, you agree not to engage in any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Fraudulent Behavior:</strong> Do not make purchases using a false identity, using payment methods without authorization, or attempt to game the system (such as falsely claiming non-receipt to get free products while actually receiving them). Such fraud can result in account termination and legal action.</li><li><strong>Circumventing the Platform:</strong> Do not attempt to contact Sellers to transact outside of Symspace for items listed on Symspace. Purchasing through Symspace ensures you have protection and that we get our small commission that keeps the platform running. Sellers are also bound by this rule; if a Seller asks you to pay them off-platform (like direct PayPal to “save fees”), please refuse and report to us. Off-platform transactions are outside this Agreement and at your own risk.</li><li><strong>Harassment or Abuse:</strong> Treat Sellers and Symspace staff with respect. You can leave honest reviews, including negative ones if deserved, but avoid using obscene, threatening, or harassing language in communications or feedback. We may intervene or suspend accounts that engage in abusive behavior.</li><li><strong>Exploiting AI/AR Tools:</strong> Symspace provides AR and AI features to help you shop. Do not use these tools for improper purposes, like extracting proprietary 3D models for use outside the platform in a way that infringes IP. Respect that the AR models you see are either owned by sellers or Symspace. The Terms of Use’s content restrictions apply (no reverse engineering or misuse of AR content).</li><li><strong>Multiple Accounts:</strong> You should not create multiple buyer accounts to circumvent restrictions or gain advantages (like multiple sign-up coupons). It’s fine to have separate buyer and seller account, or if your household has multiple users, but creating fake accounts can lead to all of them being suspended.</li></ul><h3>6.3. Reviews and Ratings</h3><p>After a purchase, you may have the opportunity to leave a review or rating for the product and/or Seller. If you do so, you agree to provide honest, fair, and factual feedback based on your actual experience. You should not include personal information (yours or others’) in a review. We do not generally moderate reviews for content except for removal of profanity, hate speech, or irrelevant/spam content, but if a Seller disputes a review as fake or malicious, we may ask you for proof of your experience. By leaving a review, you grant Symspace the right to display and use it (per our Terms of Use on content). Do not manipulate the review system, such as posting multiple reviews for the same product, or exchanging incentives for positive reviews (Sellers are not allowed to incentivize reviews either).</p><h3>6.4. Use of Chatbots/AI Assistant</h3><p>Symspace may have a chatbot or AI assistant to help answer product questions or assist in shopping. If you use it to ask questions, note that the answers are provided to assist but are not guaranteed accurate (see Terms of Use disclaimers on AI). You should verify critical info from the product listing or ask the Seller. We are not liable for decisions made based on AI chatbot guidance. Also, do not rely on chatbot for legal, medical, or professional advice; it’s for shopping-related info only.</p><h3>6.5. Buyer Verification</h3><p>We reserve the right to verify your identity or eligibility as a Buyer. For instance, for high-value orders or in cases of suspected fraud, we may request additional verification (such as requiring you to confirm small amounts charged to your card, or to provide a government ID copy). We use such info solely for fraud prevention and will handle it per our Privacy Policy. If you fail to complete verification, we may cancel the order or suspend the account.</p><h2>7. Product Quality and Intellectual Property</h2><h3>7.1. Product Quality and Authenticity</h3><p>Symspace requires Sellers to only sell authentic, lawful products. Sellers must not sell counterfeit, stolen, or illegal goods​. As a Buyer, you should receive genuine products as described. If you suspect a product you received is not authentic or as advertised (e.g., a fake brand item or a different material than described), report it to Symspace. We take such claims seriously and will investigate. If confirmed, you are entitled to a return and full refund. Symspace will also take action against the Seller (up to banning them). However, note that Symspace does not independently appraise every item’s authenticity. We rely on our Seller vetting and your vigilance. Symspace is not the manufacturer of items (unless stated), and aside from enforcing marketplace rules, we do not provide additional guarantees on product quality beyond what is provided by the Seller or manufacturer.</p><h3>7.2. Intellectual Property Use</h3><p>As a Buyer, you agree to respect the intellectual property rights associated with the products and content on the Platform. When you purchase a product, you gain ownership of the physical item, but you do not automatically gain rights to the product’s designs, images, or any 3D models beyond personal use. For example, if you buy a 3D-printed art piece, you can enjoy it, resell the physical item, etc., but you cannot replicate it or use the design for commercial purposes without permission from the IP owner. Similarly, the AR model used to preview a product is protected content; you are allowed to use it within the app to preview, but you cannot extract or use it outside Symspace without authorization. If the product comes with digital content or software, your use of that may be subject to an end-user license provided by the Seller or manufacturer.</p><h3>7.3. User-Generated AR Content</h3><p>Some products might allow you to create certain content (like customizing a model in AR, or uploading your photo to see a try-on). The terms in our Terms of Use regarding user content apply. For instance, if you upload a photo of your room to try furniture, we won’t use that photo for anything except the AR function and as per Privacy Policy. If you share a composite image (product in your room) publicly, that’s your content combined with our tools; you should ensure that doesn’t infringe others’ rights (e.g., don’t share a picture of someone else’s private space without permission, etc.).</p><h3>7.4. Third-Party IP Claims</h3><p>If a third-party (say, a brand owner) claims that a listing or product infringes their IP (trademark, copyright, etc.), Symspace may take down the listing and coordinate returns if needed. As a Buyer, if you unknowingly bought an infringing product (like a bootleg merchandise), you will be eligible for a return/refund as the item should not have been sold. We may provide instructions on how to dispose of the item (you might be asked not to use or resell it). We aim to minimize these scenarios by careful Seller vetting, but in the event it happens, we’ll handle it case-by-case.</p><h3>7.5. Augmented Reality and Safety</h3><p>We already noted caution in AR use. Just to reiterate: while using AR to view products, ensure you stay safe. The AR experiences might involve moving around; watch for real-world obstacles. Symspace disclaims liability for any injuries or accidents while using AR features (see Terms of Use disclaimers) – that’s outside the product quality context but part of using the platform.</p><h2>8. Dispute Resolution for Buyers</h2><p><em>(Refer also to the Dispute Resolution section in the Terms of Use, which fully applies to any disputes involving your use of the Symspace Platform, including purchases.)</em></p><h3>8.1. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p>As a Buyer, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this Buyer Agreement or the purchase of any products via Symspace shall be resolved through binding arbitration, on an individual basis, in accordance with Section 12 of the Terms of Use above. This includes disputes against Symspace, and (to the extent legally allowed) disputes you might raise against a Seller that relate to transactions on Symspace, since you and the Seller have both agreed to Symspace’s dispute resolution as a condition of using the platform. You waive your right to a trial by jury and to participate in class actions as detailed in the Terms of Use.</p><h3>8.2. Governing Law</h3><p>This Agreement and any disputes will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA (without regard to its conflict of law principles), as stated in the Terms of Use. If you reside outside the U.S., we still ask you to abide by these dispute resolution terms to maintain a consistent approach. That said, nothing in this Agreement limits any consumer protection rights or remedies you may be entitled to under mandatory laws of your country of residence.</p><h3>8.3. Informal Resolution and Contact</h3><p>If you have a dispute, we strongly encourage you to first contact Symspace Customer Support to seek a resolution. Most issues (delivery problems, product dissatisfaction) can be resolved through refunds or other adjustments without legal intervention. We are here to help. Only if those efforts fail should either party escalate to arbitration or court (for the narrow exceptions allowing court action).</p><h3>8.4. Opt-Out</h3><p>IF you are a new user, note that you have 30 days from the date you first agreed to the Terms of Use (which includes this Buyer Agreement) to opt-out of the arbitration agreement as explained in Terms of Use Section 12.6. To do so, you must email or write to us as directed, clearly stating you wish to opt-out of arbitration. Opting out doesn’t affect any other part of this Agreement or Terms, but it means, for someone who opts out, if there’s a dispute, they could potentially go to court instead (likely small claims or as allowed).</p><h3>8.5. Jurisdiction for Small Claims or Opt-Out</h3><p>If the arbitration clause is not enforceable or if you opted out or if a claim is appropriate in small claims court, then as per Terms, you agree Delaware courts (state or federal) have jurisdiction for litigation, unless otherwise required by law (for example, if you are an EU consumer, you might have rights to sue in your home country under EU law; this clause is primarily addressing U.S. jurisdiction context).</p><p><strong>In summary</strong>, disputes as a Buyer will follow the same process as in the Terms of Use — arbitration in Delaware under AAA (or similar) rules, no class actions, etc. This is to ensure a streamlined dispute handling mechanism.</p><h2>9. Limitation of Liability (Buyer)</h2><h3>9.1. Symspace Liability</h3><p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Symspace (and its affiliates, officers, employees, and agents) will not be liable to you, the Buyer, for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to your purchases or use of the Symspace Platform. This includes, for example, damages for loss of opportunity, loss of data, loss of goodwill, or the cost of substitute products. Our maximum aggregate liability to you for all claims arising from a particular purchase will be the total amount you paid for that purchase (including any shipping/taxes) or $100, whichever is greater, unless otherwise required by law. In no event will our cumulative liability for all your purchases exceed the amount you’ve paid to Symspace in the past 12 months.</p><h3>9.2. Product and Seller Liability</h3><p>Symspace is not liable for the quality, safety, or legality of the products sold by third-party Sellers. Any injuries, damages, or losses caused by a product you purchased are generally the responsibility of the product’s manufacturer or the Seller. For example, if a lamp you bought on Symspace malfunctions and causes a fire, Symspace did not manufacture that lamp; we facilitate the sale. While we may assist in communication or claims, Symspace disclaims liability for product defects or recalls, except to the extent required by law. Sellers on our platform agree to indemnify Symspace for product issues, and you agree that your remedies lie with the Seller or manufacturer. That said, Symspace will help coordinate with Sellers in such events (like connecting you to the manufacturer for warranty or recall information, etc.).</p><h3>9.3. AR/AI Specific Disclaimers</h3><p>Symspace is not liable for any harm or damages arising from your use of AR visualization or AI recommendations. For instance, if you rely on the AR view and as a result order a couch that ultimately doesn’t fit through your door, we understand the frustration but we are not liable for the costs incurred (we’ll facilitate a return, but not, say, reimburse your door removal unless required by law). Or if an AI styling suggestion leads you to purchase items that you end up not liking, that doesn’t create liability for Symspace. These tools are provided “as-is” and for convenience. Always exercise your own judgment.</p><h3>9.4. Transportation Risk</h3><p>Once products are shipped, risk passes to you as noted. If a carrier fails or delays (like shipping strikes, global pandemics, natural disasters delaying shipments), Symspace isn’t liable for those external events. We will do our best to keep you informed and work out solutions (like refunds if undeliverable), but we don’t owe damages for late delivery beyond what we state in this Agreement.</p><h3>9.5. No Warranty</h3><p>To reiterate from Terms of Use, Symspace provides the marketplace service on an “as is” basis without warranties. While this is more about the platform, it extends to how we don’t provide any warranty on products sold (the manufacturer or seller may, which you’ll have separately). Symspace disclaims implied warranties like merchantability or fitness for particular purpose of the products; those are between you and seller/manufacturer, except where law forbids disclaimers.</p><h3>9.6. Local Law Exceptions</h3><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations or exclusions of liability, so some of the above may not apply to you. For example, in the EU, a marketplace might have certain liabilities that cannot be fully disclaimed in consumer contracts. We do not aim to override any non-waivable rights. In any case, our liability is limited to the maximum extent permissible by applicable law.</p><h2>10. Indemnification (Buyer)</h2><h3>10.1.</h3><p>As a Buyer, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Symspace and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Symspace Parties”) from any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:</p><ul><li>Your breach of this Buyer Agreement or the general Terms of Use</li><li>Any content you submit in reviews or communications</li><li>Your violation of any law or regulations in connection with your use of Symspace</li><li>Any fraud or misrepresentation by you</li></ul><h3>10.2. Example</h3><p>If you purchase something and then use it in a way that causes damage and the manufacturer or someone tries to implicate Symspace, you would defend and indemnify us. Or if you use the platform to harass a seller and that leads to a legal dispute, you indemnify us from those consequences.</p><h3>10.3.</h3><p>We will notify you promptly of any such claim and cooperate (at your expense) in the defense. You shall have control of the defense and settlement, provided you don’t settle any claim in a way that imposes non-monetary liabilities on Symspace without our written consent. Symspace reserves the right to participate in the defense with counsel of its own choosing at its expense.</p><p>This indemnification clause doesn’t require you to indemnify for Symspace’s own negligence or willful misconduct to the extent that is not allowed by law. It’s mainly to protect us from issues caused by your wrongful actions or misuse.</p><h2>11. Miscellaneous (Buyer Agreement)</h2><h3>11.1. Relationship of Parties</h3><p>Nothing in this Buyer Agreement creates any agency, partnership, or joint venture between you and Symspace, or you and any Seller. You are an independent, end consumer.</p><h3>11.2. Severability</h3><p>If any provision of this Buyer Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be severed to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions will remain in full effect.</p><h3>11.3. No Waiver</h3><p>Symspace’s or your failure to enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision.</p><h3>11.4. </h3><p>You may not assign or transfer this Agreement (or your account or any rights/obligations herein) without Symspace’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign in violation of this is void.</p><h3>11.5. Entire Agreement</h3><p>This Buyer Agreement, together with the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and any other policies incorporated by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Symspace regarding buying on the Platform.</p><h3>11.6. Updates to Agreement</h3><p>We may modify this Buyer Agreement from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes. Your continued purchases after the effective date of the updated Agreement constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p><h3>11.7. Survival</h3><p>Any provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination of your account or this Agreement (such as payment obligations, dispute resolution, limitation of liability, indemnification, etc.) will survive.</p><p><strong>By making a purchase on Symspace, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Buyer Agreement and agree to be bound by it. We appreciate your business and aim to provide an excellent AR-enhanced shopping experience!</strong></p><p><em>Happy shopping in Symspace!</em></p>"

      question: "Seller Terms & Conditions", 
      answer: "<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> March 21, 2025</p><p>This Symspace Seller Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legally binding contract between Symspace Labs, Inc. (“Symspace,” “we,” or “us”) and you, the Seller (“Seller” or “you”), governing your participation as a third-party seller on the Symspace marketplace platform. By registering for a Symspace seller account or listing any products/services for sale on Symspace, you agree to this Seller Agreement, as well as the Symspace Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. In the event of any conflict between this Seller Agreement and the general Terms of Use, this Seller Agreement will prevail with respect to your activities as a Seller.</p><p>Please read this Agreement carefully before listing products on Symspace. It outlines your responsibilities, Symspace’s role, fees, payment terms, and other important conditions for selling. If you do not agree to all the terms, do not use Symspace to sell products.</p><h2>1. Enrollment and Seller Account</h2><h3>1.1. Eligibility and Application:</h3><p>To sell on Symspace, you must create a seller account. You represent that you are a business entity or individual with the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement and fulfill your obligations. You must be 18 or older. As part of enrollment, you will provide information including your legal name (or business name), tax identification (if applicable), contact information, bank account for payouts, and any relevant business licenses if required for your products. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information, and to update it promptly if it changes​. Symspace reserves the right to vet sellers and approve or reject any application in our discretion. Criteria may include your product lineup, past selling experience, location, etc. We may also run background or credit checks as allowed by law (with your consent where required) as part of approval.</p><h3>1.2. Account Use:</h3><p>You will keep your seller account credentials secure and are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. Do not share your login with unauthorized persons. If you are registering on behalf of a company, the individual doing so represents they have authority to bind the company to this Agreement​. You cannot transfer or sell your seller account to another party without Symspace’s prior written consent.</p><h3>1.3. Affiliate and Partner Sellers:</h3><p>If you were invited or onboarded via a Symspace affiliate/partner program (e.g., through Techstars or another partner), you still individually agree to and are bound by this Agreement. Such partners are not liable for your obligations. Additionally, if you have multiple related entities selling on Symspace, each must have permission or their own account unless we approve an umbrella arrangement.</p><h3>1.4. Compliance & Continuous Adherence:</h3><p>By becoming a Seller, you continuously represent and warrant that you and all of your offerings comply with all Symspace policies, this Agreement, and all applicable laws​. If at any point you no longer meet eligibility (for example, your business license lapses for a regulated product), you must inform us and possibly pause or terminate selling until resolved.</p><h3>1.5. Updates to Agreement:</h3><p>Symspace may update this Seller Agreement from time to time. We will notify you (e.g., by email or platform notification) of significant changes. Your continued use of the marketplace to sell after an update constitutes acceptance of the new terms​. If you do not agree, you must stop selling and may close your seller account (fulfilling any open orders first).</p><h2>2. Symspace’s Role and Marketplace Operations</h2><h3>2.1. Platform Services:</h3><p>Symspace provides the infrastructure (website, mobile app, AR tools, Unity SDK integration, etc.) for you to list and sell your products to third-party buyers (“Customers”). Symspace also provides services such as payment processing, order management tools, and limited customer service to facilitate transactions. Symspace is not buying your products from you, nor are we taking title to your products (except in cases where Symspace itself is the seller as described in 2.6). You, as the Seller, are the merchant of record for your sales; you will be listed as the seller on order invoices and records.</p><h3>2.2. Transactions Between Seller and Customer:</h3><p>All transactions on Symspace between you and Customers are direct sales between you and the Customer​. Symspace is not a party to those contracts of sale (unless we are the Seller for our own products). The role of Symspace is to connect you with Customers and facilitate the process (similar to how a mall provides space for stores). Customers will make payment to you (via Symspace as intermediary) and you are responsible for fulfilling the order and delivering the product as described. Symspace’s acceptance of funds on your behalf and the disbursement to you (minus fees) concludes the customer’s payment obligation.</p><h3>2.3. Symspace Services and Third-Party Providers:</h3><p>Symspace may use third-party service providers to provide some services (e.g., payment processing by Stripe, AI model generation by a partner, AR engine by Unity, etc.)​. We may also introduce optional services like fulfillment or shipping label services. We will manage those relationships, but you may have to agree to additional terms (like a payment processor’s terms or a fulfillment addendum) to use those services. We will notify you accordingly.</p><h3>2.4. Marketplace Brand and Marketing:</h3><p>We may market the Symspace marketplace as a whole, including your products (like featuring them in ads or on social media). Per Section 6 below, you grant us rights to use your listings content for such promotion​. We might also provide tools for you to run promotions or advertise on the platform (subject to separate terms or fees if applicable).</p><h3>2.5. Affiliate Organizations:</h3><p>Symspace sometimes has affiliate or partner organizations (like those advocating accessibility, etc.) that help promote the platform. They may be involved in co-marketing or referrals. These partners are not your agents nor assuming liability for marketplace issues. For example, if a disability advocacy group helped onboard you because your products align with their mission, that group isn’t liable if you have a dispute with a customer. They are covered under our Terms of Use disclaimers as “Symspace Parties.” Make sure any claims you make about such affiliations in your listings are accurate and authorized.</p><h3>2.6. Symspace Direct Selling:</h3><p>Symspace reserves the right to sell products on the marketplace directly as a retailer. This means in the future Symspace might list its own products or certain curated items as the Seller. Symspace may also, in some cases, step in as the seller of record for certain transactions (for example, if we launch a “fulfilled by Symspace” program or consignment model, we might temporarily take title). Symspace’s involvement as a seller will be clearly indicated, and Symspace will comply with the same obligations as any seller (and likely higher standards since it’s our platform). By entering this Agreement, you acknowledge that Symspace may compete with you, and that Symspace’s role as operator of the marketplace and as a seller are dual but separate. Symspace will not unfairly disadvantage you in favor of its own sales; we aim for a fair marketplace. But we want it understood that you do not have exclusivity and Symspace can conduct retail activities. If Symspace does sell directly, those sales are outside the scope of this Agreement (i.e., you’re not responsible for them and they don’t affect your commission or anything).</p><h3>2.7. Non-Exclusivity:</h3><p>This Agreement is not exclusive; you are free to sell your products on other platforms or your own website. However, you are responsible for managing your inventory to avoid selling something you don’t have (overselling). If you list on multiple channels, ensure you can fulfill Symspace orders as committed. Also, if we run any specific promotions or features (like AR-exclusive bundles), you might agree temporarily not to offer exactly that bundle elsewhere – but that would be optional and case-by-case.</p><h3>2.8. Communications with Users:</h3><p>Symspace will usually handle general transactional communications with customers (order confirmations, shipping notifications). You should focus on product-specific communications (answering customer inquiries about the product, providing additional info like assembly instructions, etc.). You must not direct customers to transact off-platform, and communications on-platform should remain professional and pertinent. We monitor communications to ensure they meet guidelines (no sharing private contact info to circumvent fees, etc.).</p><h3>3. Listing and Selling Products</h3><h4>3.1. Product Listings</h4><p>You agree to create accurate, truthful, and complete listings for each product you offer. This includes providing titles, descriptions, specifications (dimensions, materials, etc.), pricing, quantity available, images/3D models, condition (if not new), and any other relevant information (like warranty, included accessories). All information you provide about the Product must be accurate, current, and not misleading or fraudulent in any way. You are responsible for any claims or representations in your content. If you use Symspace’s AI tools to help generate descriptions or 3D models, you must review and ensure their accuracy before publishing.</p><h4>3.2. Images and 3D Models</h4><p>If you have your own images or 3D models, you should upload them. They must accurately represent the product (e.g., don’t use an image of a similar product that isn’t what you’re selling). We encourage providing true-to-scale 3D models for AR; if you cannot, Symspace’s tools may assist. If Symspace’s AI generates a model for you, you still need to verify it’s correct and adjust if needed. Visuals should be clear and professional. No watermarks or extraneous text unless allowed (like “sample” for swatches maybe). If using manufacturer stock images, ensure you have rights or they are in public domain.</p><h4>3.3. Pricing</h4><p>You have the freedom to set your own prices for products. Consider that Symspace will charge fees (outlined in Section 4) so price accordingly. You must list prices inclusive of any costs on your side. “Drip pricing” (unexpected fees added later except tax/shipping calculated by system) is not allowed. If you charge separate shipping, that will be added at checkout based on settings you configure (like a flat rate or calculated by weight/dimensions to the buyer’s location). You agree not to intentionally price outrageously or engage in price gouging (especially on essential items during emergencies). Symspace may moderate or remove listings with unfair pricing or obvious errors (like $1 when you meant $100). Occasional promotions or coupons might effectively alter the price; those will be handled by the system.</p><h4>3.4. Inventory Management</h4><p>You must stock sufficient inventory to fulfill orders of your listed products, or use a just-in-time production method that meets shipping timeframes. Only list items you have the legal right and ability to sell (more on legal compliance below). If an item goes out of stock, update or pause the listing immediately to prevent overselling. If you oversell or cannot fulfill an order, you must notify Symspace ASAP and cooperate on cancellation and customer notification. Chronic failure to fulfill will result in penalties or account suspension.</p><h4>3.5. Shipping Settings</h4><p>In your seller dashboard, you’ll define how you ship: what carriers, from where (origin zip/country), handling time (time from order to dispatch), and any specific shipping rules. You can set product-specific settings if needed (like fragile item requires special packaging time). You agree to ship items within the handling time you specify; buyers rely on that for delivery expectations. If you foresee a delay (stock count wrong, supply delay), inform the buyer and Symspace. If you cannot ship within your stated handling time plus a short grace period, buyer is entitled to cancel.</p><h4>3.6. Prohibited and Restricted Products</h4><p>You may only list products that comply with Symspace’s policies and applicable laws. Certain categories are prohibited or restricted on Symspace. For example, absolutely prohibited: illegal items (drugs, stolen goods), firearms, explosive materials, pornography, live animals, counterfeit goods, etc. Restricted (allowed only with approval or certain conditions): food items (need compliance with health regs), cosmetics (must adhere to FDA rules), items with lithium batteries (must follow shipping regulations), etc. Also, products that would violate others’ IP rights (bootleg media, fake designer items) are forbidden. We will provide a detailed policy of prohibited/restricted items; you are responsible for reviewing it. Symspace at its discretion can remove or suspend any listing that it deems in violation. If requested, you must promptly remove any such listings or we will.</p><h4>3.7. Product Authenticity and Rights</h4><p>You may only sell products that are authentic, legally acquired, and that you have the right to sell. You represent and warrant that: (a) the products are not counterfeit or knock-offs; (b) if you are not the brand owner, you are an authorized reseller or otherwise have the right to sell them (for example, you sourced from legitimate distributors); (c) the sale of the products does not violate any intellectual property rights or contracts; and (d) any trademarks, logos, or branding used in your listing you have the right to use. Upon request by Symspace, you will promptly provide documentation proving authenticity or authorization for your products.</p><h4>3.8. No Infringing Content</h4><p>Your listings (including text, images, 3D models) should not include content that infringes copyrights, trademarks, or other IP rights of others. Do not copy paste product descriptions from competitors or use images from Google that you don’t have rights to. Ideally, use your own photos or those provided by the manufacturer with permission. If you repeatedly infringe, DMCA notices can lead to termination of your account.</p><h4>3.9. Unity SDK and AR Integration</h4><p>If you use Symspace’s Unity SDK components, you must follow Unity’s terms and our guidelines. Ensure any 3D models you provide are optimized and do not contain malicious code or something that could crash the AR viewer. Symspace may modify models to ensure performance. We’ll try not to change the visual fidelity. If your product uses AR in a special way, clear instructions must be provided to customers.</p><h4>3.10. Generative AI Use</h4><p>Symspace provides AI tools to help generate 3D models or descriptions. The AI is a tool; the outputs might require your review. By using it, you confirm you have rights to any input you give and that you’ll verify outputs for accuracy. You are ultimately responsible for your listings content, even if AI-assisted. Do not misuse AI (e.g., to create fake review content or spam messages – the AI features are for listing content and support only as authorized).</p><h4>3.11. Updating Listings</h4><p>You can edit or update listings at any time, but if you have pending orders, certain changes won’t affect those. If you discontinue a product, mark it out of stock or delete the listing after fulfilling any open orders. Keep your listings updated if there are changes to avoid misrepresentations.</p><h4>3.12. Multiple Channels Sales & SKU Management</h4><p>If you also sell the same products off Symspace, it’s wise to have synchronized inventory. Symspace can’t know of sales you made elsewhere. If overselling occurs, it’s on you to remedy. We might integrate with certain inventory management tools – use them if available to avoid issues.</p><h3>4. Membership, Fees, and Payment Terms</h3><h4>4.1. Symspace Marketplace Fee</h4><p>When you successfully sell an item on Symspace, we will charge a commission or referral fee. The standard commission rate will be communicated in your seller dashboard. We may adjust fees with notice. Commission is typically calculated on the gross sale amount the buyer pays for the item (excluding taxes, but including shipping unless stated otherwise).</p><h4>4.2. Payment Processing Fee</h4><p>There may be a payment processing fee per transaction. This is usually a small percentage + fixed amount and may depend on the buyer’s payment method. Typically, we might deduct it from the payout. We aim to be transparent and you will see breakdowns in your account.</p><h4>4.3. Other Fees</h4><p>Depending on optional services you use, there might be additional fees:</p><ul><li><strong>Subscription Fee</strong>: For any “Pro seller plan” with extra tools.</li><li><strong>Fulfillment Fees</strong>: If you use Symspace’s warehousing.</li><li><strong>Advertising Fees</strong>: For promoting your products.</li><li><strong>Insurance Fee</strong>: For shipping insurance or return handling.</li><li><strong>Chargeback Fees</strong>: If a customer disputes a charge not due to our error.</li></ul><p>All fees will be listed in your seller dashboard’s fee table or program terms.</p><h4>4.4. Payouts to You</h4><p>Symspace will remit the proceeds of your sales minus our fees to your designated payout account. Payouts are typically on a regular cycle for delivered orders. We may hold funds for a short period after delivery. We’ll communicate any rolling reserve or hold if applicable.</p><h4>4.5. Transaction Settlement and Reports</h4><p>After each order, you’ll see a transaction in your seller portal with the breakdown. We will provide periodic statements or reports summarizing your sales and fees. Please review these and report any discrepancies promptly.</p><h4>4.6. Customer Payments, Refunds, and Adjustments</h4><p>Symspace collects payment from the buyer at order time. If an order is refunded, Symspace will deduct the refunded amount from your account. We generally return the commission for refunded orders except in cases of seller fault.</p><p>For example, if you cancel because out-of-stock (seller fault), we might keep the commission or a cancellation fee to cover the service cost and disappointed customer. If the refund is due to our or payment processing error, we won’t make you eat costs. We try to be fair in aligning incentives: legitimate returns/refunds usually mean we reverse our fee (especially if product returned), whereas abusing refunds (lots of cancellations) might incur penalties.</p><h4>4.7. Shipping Fees and Labels</h4><p>If you purchase shipping labels through Symspace’s system (if we integrate carriers for you), the cost of those labels will typically be deducted from your balance or charged to your payment method on file. We often net it from your sales proceeds. If a label is unused or refunded, we credit back accordingly. Using our shipping tool might get you discounted rates but you’re not forced to (unless part of a fulfillment program requirement). If you handle shipping totally yourself, make sure to still provide tracking info and mark shipped on the platform.</p><h4>4.8. Taxes on Fees</h4><p>Our fees are charged for services rendered and might be subject to tax (like VAT on seller fees if you’re in certain countries). Symspace may collect any applicable taxes on fees from you, which could appear as separate charges. For example, if you’re in a country where VAT applies to marketplace service fees, we’ll add that to the commission or invoice you. You are responsible for any taxes on the fees (without reduction of amounts owed to us). We will provide invoices for fees upon request if needed for your records.</p><h4>4.9. Changes to Fees</h4><p>Symspace will strive to maintain competitive fees. If we change our standard commission or add new fees, we will give at least 14 days’ notice (or longer if required by law). Temporary promotions (lower fees for certain categories or time) might come with shorter notice if positive. If you don’t agree to any fee changes, your recourse is to stop selling before they take effect (fulfill existing obligations though).</p><h4>4.10. No Circumvention</h4><p>You agree not to attempt to circumvent the fee structure. Examples of prohibited behavior include:</p><ul><li>Encouraging buyers to cancel an order and re-pay you off-platform</li><li>Misclassifying a product under a category with lower commission if it doesn’t belong</li><li>Artificially inflating shipping charge and lowering item price to reduce commission (if commission only on item price)</li></ul><p>Note: we might structure fees to close such loopholes, e.g., commission on total. We reserve the right to withhold payouts or charge penalties if we detect fee circumvention.</p><h4>4.11. Membership Cancellation and Refund Policy</h4><ul><li><strong>Cancellation Period:</strong> Sellers who register as Symspace Marketplace members have the right to cancel their membership within seven (7) calendar days from the confirmation date of membership activation.</li><li><strong>Refund Policy:</strong> If cancellation is requested within this 7-day Cancellation Period, Symspace will issue a full refund of any membership fees paid. Refunds will be processed to the original payment method within fourteen (14) business days from the confirmed cancellation date.</li><li><strong>How to Cancel:</strong> To initiate cancellation, sellers must submit a written cancellation request clearly indicating the intent to terminate their membership via email to <em>[insert your cancellation email address here]</em> or through the seller’s dedicated account portal on Symspace Marketplace. Requests must be received and timestamped within the Cancellation Period.</li><li><strong>Post-Cancellation Responsibilities:</strong> Upon confirmed cancellation, sellers agree to immediately discontinue any use of Symspace branding, remove references to the partnership from marketing materials or external communications, and cease representing themselves as official marketplace members.</li><li><strong>No Exceptions After Period Ends:</strong> Cancellation requests made after the 7-day period will not qualify for refunds unless specifically required by applicable laws or authorized by Symspace at its sole discretion.</li></ul><h2>5. Order Fulfillment and Customer Service</h2><h3>5.1. Order Processing</h3><p>You will regularly check for new orders (via the seller portal or notifications we send). You must acknowledge and ship orders within the handling time you set. Ideally, mark the order as shipped and provide tracking information once available. If your handling time is X days and you realize you need more, communicate with the customer (through the platform) and ask Symspace for extension if needed, but the customer has right to cancel if delayed.</p><h3>5.2. Shipping and Delivery</h3><p>As Seller, you are responsible for properly packaging the products to prevent damage, and shipping them via reliable carriers. Adhere to any special shipping service the customer paid for (e.g., if they chose expedited, you must use that speed service). Insert any required documentation (packing slip, manuals, etc.). Do not include any marketing material that directs customers off-platform (like “Shop next time at our site for discount” – you can have your brand info and customer service contacts, but not solicit off-site sales). Ensure compliance with shipping regulations (hazmat, customs forms for international shipments with accurate info).</p><h3>5.3. Shipping Costs and Free Shipping</h3><p>You may offer free shipping or charge a fee. Manage this in your pricing strategy. If you offer free shipping, you bear the cost. If customer pays shipping, you should use that to cover the label. If actual shipping cost ends up higher than what customer paid due to your miscalculation, that difference is on you; you cannot come back to ask the customer for more after the fact (unless dimensions drastically changed due to say an agreed change in order).</p><h3>5.4. Tracking and Confirmation</h3><p>Provide tracking numbers for shipments whenever possible. Symspace may integrate with certain carriers so tracking updates flow to the customer automatically. Tracking serves as proof of delivery in case of disputes, so it’s in your interest to always have it. For low value items, if you choose not to track, you assume the risk. For high value (we encourage requiring signature confirmation for, say, items over $250 or so, and insuring them). The cost of any added insurance or signature is generally on you, but you can factor that into shipping cost or price.</p><h3>5.5. Delivery Issues</h3><p>If a package is delayed or lost in transit, you should assist the customer with investigation (contact the carrier, etc.). Ultimately, non-delivery is your responsibility to resolve – either by sending a replacement or issuing a refund to the buyer. Symspace may step in if you don’t make the customer whole for lost orders (and may reimburse them and charge you). Ensure addresses are used exactly as provided; if something is unclear, reach out to customer promptly via message for clarification.</p><h3>5.6. Customer Inquiries</h3><p>Buyers may ask questions about your products (prior to purchase) or about their order (post-purchase). You are expected to respond to customer messages courteously and within a reasonable time (preferably within 1-2 business days). Answer questions truthfully; if you’re not sure (like a technical spec), try to find out rather than guess. Good communication leads to better reviews and fewer returns. For AR-related queries (like “the model in AR looks different than expected”), try to clarify if it's just visualization or if product might indeed differ. You can escalate to Symspace if the question involves platform features or something you can’t handle.</p><h3>5.7. Returns and Refunds</h3><p>You must honor the return policy you state on your listings, at minimum adhering to the default that Symspace provides for consistent customer experience (which is generally a 30-day return policy for many categories). If you have a different policy (e.g., final sale or shorter window), it must be clearly disclosed on the product page. However, note that certain consumer protection laws might override (for example, defective products often have to be accepted for return regardless of your stated policy). You are responsible for processing returns from customers in a timely manner. Symspace’s system may facilitate creating return labels for the customer. If an item is returned to you, inspect it and inform us to issue the refund (Symspace can handle the actual fund transfer back to customer; you’ll be debited that amount). If item is not in the expected condition on return, you should document it and discuss partial refund with the customer through Symspace. We advise a fair solution to avoid disputes. Sellers can set up partial refund guidelines (like 20% restocking fee for open box returns) but these must be clearly communicated and within reason.</p><h3>5.8. Warranties</h3><p>If you offer any warranty on your products (manufacturer or seller warranty), you must provide details to customers and honor them. For example, if you sell electronics with 1-year warranty, you should assist the customer if something breaks in that period (either directly or via manufacturer liaison). If you are the brand, that’s on you. If you’re reselling another brand’s product, provide the manufacturer warranty info and help the customer contact them as needed. Symspace does not provide any warranties on your behalf, but we expect that you will not misrepresent the existence or terms of a product warranty.</p><h3>5.9. Customer Complaints and Disputes</h3><p>If a customer is dissatisfied (item not as described, missing part, etc.), work to resolve it amicably – possibly offering a return, replacement part, or partial refund if appropriate. Maintain professionalism even if the customer is upset. If you cannot resolve it, the customer or you can escalate to Symspace (“Symspace Guarantee” claim or similar). We will then mediate and possibly refund the buyer from your account as per our policies. It’s best to avoid that by good service upfront.</p><h3>5.10. Metrics and Performance</h3><p>Symspace may track seller performance metrics such as order defect rate (cases of returns for cause, chargebacks, etc.), late shipment rate, response time to customers, cancellation rate, etc. We will share these metrics with you. Consistently poor performance may lead to warnings, temporary suspension, or termination of your selling privileges. We will usually provide notice and a chance to improve unless it’s an egregious violation. Strive to maintain high positive feedback from buyers. Symspace may also have a review/rating system for sellers. If you receive negative reviews, address the issues and perhaps respond publicly if allowed (politely clarifying any misunderstanding or noting resolution).</p><h3>5.11. Symspace Fulfillment (if offered)</h3><p>At this time, you are responsible for your own fulfillment unless you partake in a Symspace fulfillment service (SymFulfill or similar, if launched). If you do join such a program, a separate addendum will detail how Symspace stores, picks, packs, and ships on your behalf, and fees for that. The terms here would then adjust accordingly (like you’d ensure inventory arrives at our warehouse, etc., and we’d handle some responsibilities). Absent that, all fulfillment duties are yours.</p><h2>6. Content License and Intellectual Property</h2><h3>6.1. License to Symspace</h3><p>To operate the marketplace, you grant Symspace and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, irrevocable (for the term of any intellectual property rights) license to use, reproduce, display, distribute, and create derivative works from all content you provide to us (such as product images, 3D models, descriptions, trademarks and logos) in connection with the Symspace Platform and our marketing efforts. This means, for example, we can display your listings on our site and apps, use your product images in email newsletters or ads promoting Symspace, resize or crop images to fit our site design, generate 3D previews or variants from your models, translate your descriptions for other locales, etc. We will not, however, sell your content to third parties or use it outside of promoting your listings and the marketplace. This license endures for as long as your content is available on our platform, and for a reasonable time after (to let caches clear, or if we included an image in a marketing piece, we won’t try to claw it back).</p><h3>6.2. Customer Sharing</h3><p>You acknowledge Symspace can allow customers or site visitors to share your content (e.g., via social media share buttons, or AR snapshots). This is common user behavior, and often beneficial (free marketing). Our license to them is to use such shared content for personal, non-commercial use (like a buyer showing a friend the item they bought). You agree that such sharing by users is allowed and you won’t claim IP infringement against such actions originated through platform features.</p><h3>6.3. Use of Symspace IP</h3><p>Symspace’s trademarks (name, logos) and any of its own copyrighted content (site design, text, etc.) are our property. We grant you a limited license to use the Symspace name/logo only as needed to indicate you are selling on Symspace (e.g., you can say “Visit my shop on Symspace” with our logo in accordance with any brand guidelines we provide). You cannot misrepresent yourself as an employee or agent of Symspace or use our brand in a way that confuses customers. Any goodwill from permitted use of our marks inures to us. If we update brand guidelines or revoke permission, you agree to comply.</p><h3>6.4. Ownership</h3><p>Except for the license rights above, you retain ownership of all your intellectual property in your content and products. Symspace doesn’t claim ownership of your trademarks or product designs. If a product sells, that transaction doesn’t transfer any of your IP rights to Symspace (only to the buyer to own that copy). Conversely, any content Symspace or its users create that isn’t derived from yours remains owned by them/us. For instance, if Symspace takes generic AR background imagery, you don’t own that by having your model shown on it.</p><h3>6.5. Intellectual Property Infringement Claims</h3><p>You must notify Symspace immediately if you believe any content on our platform (including your own) infringes IP rights. We comply with DMCA and have processes to remove infringing content. If a takedown notice is specifically about your listing, we will forward it to you (if valid) and may remove the listing. You have the right to counter-notice if you believe it’s mistaken. Repeated infringement by sellers will lead to termination. Also, if you inadvertently use someone else’s protected content (like a stock photo you didn’t have rights for), once alerted, remove or replace it promptly.</p><h3>6.6. Symspace’s Use of AI with Your Content</h3><p>Part of the service might involve Symspace analyzing your provided content or sales data with AI (for example, to improve search or generate better descriptions, or to train a model that helps auto-generate 3D objects). We will do so in accordance with our Privacy Policy and maintaining confidentiality of your sensitive data. Any AI-trained improvements that are general (like an algorithm that better renders 3D from 2D images using many sellers’ data) is owned by Symspace. But we won’t use your specific product data to create something to compete with you directly (e.g., we won’t take your unique design and have AI produce a copy for another seller). This is more of a trust statement than a legal clause.</p><section><h2>7. Compliance with Laws and Policies</h2><h3>7.1. Legal Compliance</h3><p>You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards in connection with your use of Symspace and your selling activities. This includes but is not limited to: consumer protection laws (truthful advertising, proper labeling, product safety standards), privacy laws (if you gather any personal info through e.g., warranty cards, you must handle it lawfully), intellectual property laws (selling authorized goods, respecting IP), export/import laws (not selling items to buyers where prohibited, filling out customs forms accurately), environmental regulations (if selling electronics with battery disposal requirements, etc.), and any required licenses or permits (like FCC compliance for electronics, or FDA compliance for cosmetics or medical devices). You are solely responsible for determining what laws apply to your products and business and ensuring compliance.</p><h3>7.2. Specific Regulatory Areas</h3><ul><li><strong>Product Safety:</strong> All products should meet safety standards. Toys, electronics, anything with potential hazards must comply with relevant certification (ex: UL listing for electrical if needed, CPSIA for children’s products, etc.). No recalled products should be sold.</li><li><strong>Food/Cosmetics:</strong> If you sell these, ensure labeling with ingredients, allergens, expiration dates as required. No selling of expired or soon-to-expire goods unless clearly noted and allowed.</li><li><strong>Drugs/Supplements:</strong> These are heavily regulated. Only allowed if fully compliant with FDA (or equivalent) regulations and allowed by Symspace’s category rules. Likely you need pre-approval to list.</li><li><strong>Alcohol/Tobacco/Adult:</strong> These categories might be disallowed on Symspace entirely or allowed only with strict conditions (age verification, licenses). Do not list without explicit permission and process in place.</li><li><strong>Export Control and Sanctions:</strong> You cannot sell to countries or individuals under U.S. (or relevant) sanctions. Symspace system may block certain regions. Don’t attempt to bypass. Also, if your product has export restrictions (like some tech or defense-related items), do not list unless vetted.</li><li><strong>Taxes:</strong> You must comply with tax laws. See Section 8 for specifics on how transaction taxes are handled between us and you.</li></ul><h3>7.3. Abiding by Marketplace Policies</h3><p>Beyond laws, Symspace will have its own policies (some mentioned throughout: content standards, return minimums, etc.). These will be provided in a seller handbook or policy page. You agree to familiarize and follow them. They are incorporated by reference into this Agreement. For instance, policies may cover: prohibited content in listings, required seller response times, how to handle customer data (e.g., if buyer shares personal measurements for a custom fit, you must keep that secure and only use for that order), etc. We may update policies over time and will notify you or post changes. Continual violation of policies can lead to enforcement action including suspension.</p><h3>7.4. Insurance</h3><p>You acknowledge that as a business, you may be subject to liability for your products (like product liability if something causes injury). Symspace strongly recommends you maintain adequate insurance coverage for your protection, including general commercial liability and product liability insurance. While not always mandatory initially, Symspace reserves the right to require you to obtain certain insurance and to list Symspace as an additional insured on it. If we notify you of such requirement (likely if you reach a sales threshold or sell in a risk category), you agree to comply within 30 days. You will provide certificates of insurance to us upon request. For example, if you sell electronics that could overheat, we might insist on product liability insurance after you hit $50k in sales. Insurance will protect both you and Symspace in event of claims. If you fail to procure it when required, we may suspend your listings until you do.</p><h3>7.5. Taxes – Seller’s Responsibility</h3><p>Apart from transaction taxes which we handle as marketplace (see Section 8), you are responsible for your own business taxes: income tax on earnings, any required corporate taxes, VAT if you have obligations in your home jurisdiction for what you sell, etc. Symspace does not withhold any income tax for you (unless required by law like certain non-U.S. seller U.S. withholding, etc.). You should consult a tax advisor to ensure you file appropriately. Also if you have nexus in certain states or countries beyond what marketplace facilitator covers, it's on you to handle those taxes.</p><h3>7.6. Record-Keeping and Audit</h3><p>Keep records of your transactions, inventory, and communications as needed to demonstrate compliance. Symspace may request documentation at times to verify compliance (like supplier invoices as mentioned, safety certificates, etc.). We may also audit your use of the marketplace via automated means or manual review to ensure no policy breaches. You agree to cooperate and provide truthful information during any investigation or audit.</p><h3>7.7. Indemnity for Non-Compliance</h3><p>As elaborated in Section 10, you will indemnify Symspace for any costs or losses arising from your failure to comply with laws or policies. For example, if you sold an illegal item and we get fined or sued, you cover those costs. Or if you didn’t pay required taxes and a government seeks them from Symspace, you reimburse those.</p><h2>8. Taxes (Sales Tax, VAT, etc.)</h2><h3>8.1. Marketplace Facilitator</h3><p>In many jurisdictions (like most U.S. states, some other countries), Symspace as a marketplace may be required or has opted to collect and remit sales tax, VAT, or similar transaction taxes on sales to customers. Where Symspace is legally considered a “marketplace facilitator” or “marketplace operator” for tax, we will handle calculating, collecting, and remitting those taxes on your behalf for your sales. For instance, in the U.S., if a buyer is in California, Symspace will charge them the California sales tax rate for the product and shipping (if taxable) and remit it to California. We will relieve you of the obligation to remit that particular tax (though you should report that the marketplace did it, depending on local law).</p><h3>8.2. Jurisdictions Covered</h3><p>Symspace will provide a list of jurisdictions where we collect/remit. For U.S., it may be all states with sales tax, as laws now cover that. For other countries, possibly we’ll handle EU VAT on digital services, etc. If a sale occurs to a location not covered by our system (e.g., a country where we aren’t set up to collect VAT and you have liability), you are responsible to handle that outside our system. However, typically we aim to cover major markets or restrict sales where tax can’t be handled.</p><h3>8.3. Seller’s Tax Obligations</h3><p>You must provide us any information needed for tax purposes: e.g., your VAT ID, GST ID, state reseller certificates, etc. If you have a valid exemption for certain taxes (like selling wholesale, or a buyer is tax-exempt entity), we need documentation to handle that properly. For VAT in the EU/UK, Symspace might be deemed the “deemed supplier” for cross-border e-commerce for low-value goods as per new rules. We will manage those where required. If you as Seller have any required registration or tax collection obligations not handled by us, you must fulfill them. Also, you must not use Symspace to commit tax evasion or fraud (ex: mischaracterizing an item to avoid higher duty).</p><h3>8.4. Tax on Seller Income</h3><p>As noted, your income tax or business tax obligations remain yours. Symspace may issue required forms (like a 1099-K in the U.S. summarizing sales if thresholds met). Make sure we have your correct taxpayer info (W-9 or W-8 for foreigners) so we can comply with IRS rules. If you don’t provide it, we may have to withhold certain percentages as backup withholding and remit to IRS, which will be deducted from your payouts.</p><h3>8.5. Import/Export</h3><p>If you ship internationally, you (or the buyer depending on terms) are responsible for any customs duties or import VAT in the destination. Typically the buyer pays those on arrival. You should accurately fill customs declarations (as seller/shipper) with correct value and description to avoid legal issues. Symspace is not the exporter or importer of record, you are (or the buyer as importer). Ensure no illegal exports (like US items to sanctioned countries) and proper export licenses if needed.</p><h3>8.6. Cooperation</h3><p>If any tax authority audits Symspace regarding transactions involving your sales, you agree to cooperate and provide needed info. Similarly, if needed, we can share relevant transaction info with tax authorities as required (like in EU, marketplace must keep certain VAT-related records for 10 years and provide to authorities upon request; you acknowledge we’ll do so).</p>  <h2>9. Term and Termination; Suspension</h2><h3>9.1. Term</h3><p>This Agreement becomes effective on the date you register as a seller or first list a product, and continues until terminated by either party as outlined herein.</p><h3>9.2. Voluntary Termination by Seller</h3><p>You may terminate this Agreement (i.e., stop selling on Symspace) at any time by providing notice to Symspace (e.g., via seller dashboard setting to close account or written notice to support). However, you must fulfill any outstanding orders or pending obligations. If you have open orders, ideally wait until they’re completed or work with us to cancel/refund them appropriately. Upon termination, your seller account will be closed and your listings removed.</p><h3>9.3. Termination or Suspension by Symspace</h3><p>Symspace may suspend your account or terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving you notice (e.g., email). We may suspend/terminate immediately in certain cases, including:</p><ul><li>Serious or repeat violation of this Agreement, policies, or law (selling prohibited items, high rate of fake products, fraud).</li><li>Actions that pose risk to Symspace or buyers (e.g., payment fraud, hacking attempts).</li><li>Consistently poor performance or customer feedback indicating inability to meet standards.</li><li>If mandated by law or at request of law enforcement (e.g., you’re selling illegally).</li><li>If you become insolvent or file bankruptcy (we might terminate if we suspect you can’t fulfill orders).</li></ul><p>In cases of minor issues, we typically suspend (prevent new sales) and give chance to correct before terminating permanently.</p><h3>9.4. Effect of Suspension/Termination</h3><p>During suspension, your active listings may be paused (buyers can’t purchase). You must still fulfill in-transit orders. We may hold payouts until issues are resolved. If terminated, all your listings are removed; you shouldn’t access or use seller features. Termination does not absolve either party of obligations incurred prior: you still owe any fees accrued, and we still owe any payouts for delivered orders. Sections of this Agreement that by nature should survive (indemnity, liability limits, etc.) will survive termination.</p><h3>9.5. Withholding of Funds</h3><p>If your account is terminated due to misconduct or high risk of claims, Symspace may temporarily withhold some or all of your funds to cover potential refunds, chargebacks, or liabilities. For example, if we terminated you for selling counterfeit items, we might hold your last payouts for a reasonable period to ensure customers have time to claim refunds. Any funds not used for claims will be released to you after that period. The period might be up to 90–180 days (similar to payment processors’ reserve practices) depending on the situation. We’ll communicate if we are doing this. This is in addition to any offsets we might do (deducting what you owe). If obligations exceed funds, you still owe the difference.</p><h3>9.6. Appeal</h3><p>If you feel a suspension or termination was in error or unfair, you can appeal by contacting our seller support or a specific appeals channel. Provide any evidence or corrective action plan. We will review in good faith and either reinstate under conditions or uphold the decision. Our primary concern is marketplace integrity and customer safety.</p><h3>9.7. Closure for Inactivity</h3><p>If your seller account has been completely inactive for a long period (say, no logins or listings for 12+ months) and no outstanding funds, Symspace reserves the right to close it. We’d notify you at your last email on file. If no response, we’ll terminate. You can reapply later if you wish.</p><h2>10. Indemnification</h2><h3>10.1. Seller Indemnity</h3><p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Symspace and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Symspace Parties”) from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:</p><ul><li>(a) Your breach of any representation, warranty, or obligation in this Agreement​ (e.g., false specs leading to a claim).</li><li>(b) Your own sales channels or activities outside Symspace (e.g., issues on your site that somehow involve Symspace).</li><li>(c) Your Products – including product liability, death, personal injury, or property damage from them, and any related claims (e.g., manufacturing defects).</li><li>(d) Your Retailer Product Content – any claim that the content you provided infringes intellectual property, is defamatory, or unlawful.</li><li>(e) Tax obligations – any taxes, duties, penalties, or interest from your Symspace transactions (unless we explicitly handle them).</li><li>(f) Your misuse of the Symspace platform – including scraping, abusing APIs, or privacy violations.</li><li>(g) Any breach of law – including selling illegal items or violating consumer protection laws.</li></ul><p>This indemnity covers third-party claims (including buyers, IP owners, regulators) related to your products or conduct, even if groundless.</p><h3>10.2. Procedure</h3><p>If Symspace faces a claim that triggers your indemnity, we will notify you promptly in writing. You will then assume the defense with counsel reasonably acceptable to us. We may choose to be defended by you or to participate with our own counsel (at our cost). You agree to cooperate fully as needed. You may not settle any claim in a way that admits fault of Symspace or imposes non-monetary obligations on us without our consent. If you do not diligently defend, Symspace can assume defense and you’ll reimburse all costs and any judgment or settlement. We will use Indemnity Counsel Guidelines similar to Walmart’s approach if needed (expecting competent representation and information).</p><h3>10.3. Additional Insured</h3><p>If we require insurance, we’ll be additional insured so that insurance covers some of this. But regardless, if insurers don’t, you do per this clause.</p><h3>10.4. No Limitation</h3><p>Your indemnification responsibilities are in addition to any insurance or other remedy and are not limited by any liability cap when it comes to third-party claims. If a third party comes after Symspace for something that is fundamentally your fault, you bear the cost fully.</p><h2>11. Limitation of Liability (Symspace to Seller)</h2><h3>11.1. No Consequential Damages</h3><p>To the extent permitted by law, Symspace and the Symspace Parties will not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Symspace platform, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, without limitation, damages for lost profits, lost sales, business interruption, loss of data, or cost of procurement of substitute services. For example, if the Symspace site goes down for a day and you lose potential sales, or if an AR glitch causes a buyer to not buy, we’re not liable for those lost opportunities.</p><h3>11.2. Cap on Liability</h3><p>To the fullest extent allowed by law, Symspace’s total liability to you for any claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, is limited to the total amount of fees (commission) you paid to Symspace in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the liability or $100, whichever is greater. Since typically we collect fees rather than you paying us, one could interpret as fees we took from your sales (which is effectively what you paid us), or just $100 if that’s more. But realistically, since we don’t charge monthly fees as of now, our exposure is minimal and this ensures we aren’t on the hook beyond that.</p><h3>11.3. Platform Provided “As Is”</h3><p>Symspace provides the marketplace, AR features, and related services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We make no warranty that the platform will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that defects will be corrected timely. As a seller, you assume the risks of technology issues. We will try to maintain good uptime and fix issues, but we disclaim warranties like merchantability, fitness for particular purpose, etc., in providing the service to you.</p><h3>11.4. No Guarantee of Sales or Results</h3><p>Symspace does not guarantee that you will sell any given amount, reach any audience, or achieve any particular outcome by using our marketplace. Any metrics or projections we might provide (like “AR can increase sales by X%”) are for informational purposes and not a guarantee. You agree that Symspace is not liable for your success or failure to sell products.</p><h3>11.5. Third-Party Services</h3><p>If you use any third-party services in connection with Symspace (like a linked shipping app or analytics tool via API, or even Unity’s SDK inside our app), Symspace is not liable for the acts or omissions of those third parties. For example, if a payment processor has an outage or a bug in Unity causes an AR display error, our liability is limited as above.</p><h3>11.6. Legal Exceptions</h3><p>Some jurisdictions may not allow certain limitations. For example, in some places, you can’t disclaim liability for gross negligence or willful misconduct. We certainly aren’t trying to disclaim that—if we intentionally harm you, that’s on us. Also, this doesn’t override any statutory rights you have that can’t be waived. But in general, this sets the understanding that our liability is very limited. If a court finds any part of this unenforceable, it should enforce to maximum extent.</p><h2>12. Miscellaneous Provisions (Seller Agreement)</h2><h3>12.1. Governing Law</h3><p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to conflict of law principles​. However, since your activities might span regions, you also agree to comply with any local laws about selling. The choice of Delaware primarily matters for dispute resolution between you and Symspace.</p><h3>12.2. Dispute Resolution</h3><p>As stated in the Terms of Use and mirrored here, any dispute between you (Seller) and Symspace will be resolved by binding arbitration in Delaware, unless you opted out or an exception applies, following the same process as with buyers (Section 8 above, which references Terms of Use Section 12). As a Seller, you also agree not to bring class or collective actions. Essentially, you can’t sue us in court (except small claims or injunctive relief for IP perhaps) – it has to go to arbitration. See Terms of Use for details on opting out or exceptions. Delaware courts (state or federal) have exclusive jurisdiction for any allowed court proceedings.</p><h3>12.3. Relationship of Parties</h3><p>You and Symspace are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement creates an employment, partnership, joint venture, agency, or franchise relationship between us​. You have no authority to make or accept any offers or representations on Symspace’s behalf, and vice versa except as explicitly stated (Symspace acts as your agent for payment processing as described earlier, but that is limited). You operate your business at your own risk and reward.</p><h3>12.4. No Exclusivity or Non-Compete</h3><p>This Agreement does not restrict you from selling elsewhere, nor restricts Symspace from allowing other sellers (including competitors of yours) on the platform. Symspace also may at times produce similar products or white label items – there’s no non-compete guarantee here. Each party can engage in similar or competitive activities.</p><h3>12.5. Assignment</h3><p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without Symspace’s prior written consent​. Any assignment attempt without consent is void. Symspace can assign or transfer this Agreement (for example, if we get acquired or merge, or delegate to an affiliate) upon notice to you (which could be via posting updated terms reflecting the new entity).</p><h3>12.6. Modifications</h3><p>Aside from general updates to this Agreement which we handle via notice to all sellers, any changes specific to you (like an amendment for a special program) must be in writing and agreed by both parties. The failure of either party to enforce any provision is not a waiver of the right to do so later.</p><h3>12.7. Severability</h3><p>If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the Agreement remains in effect. For instance, if arbitration clause was not enforceable in a scenario, the rest of obligations still bind, and we’d possibly resolve disputes in court individually.</p><h3>12.8. Entire Agreement</h3><p>This Agreement, together with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and any policies or guidelines incorporated by reference (like prohibited items policy, fee schedule, etc.), constitutes the entire agreement between you and Symspace regarding your use of the marketplace as a Seller​. It supersedes any prior discussions or agreements (like if someone told you verbally something else, this written contract is what applies). In case of conflict, as earlier stated, this Seller Agreement overrides the general Terms for subjects it covers specifically.</p><h3>12.9. Notices</h3><p>Notices under this Agreement will be given: (a) by Symspace to you via email to the address on your account, via internal dashboard message, or via certified mail to any physical address you provided; (b) by you to Symspace via email to our seller support or an address we designate (e.g., contact@symspacelabs.com) or via certified mail to our corporate address. Email is considered written notice. You are responsible for keeping your contact info updated to receive notices.</p><h3>12.10. Force Majeure</h3><p>Symspace is not liable for any delay or failure to perform its obligations due to events outside its reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, war, cyberattacks, etc.). Similarly, if such events affect your ability to fulfill orders, let us and customers know; while you are technically responsible, we will consider such events in enforcement of certain obligations.</p><h3>12.11. Publicity</h3><p>You will not use the name, logo, or trademarks of Symspace or its affiliates in any press release, marketing, or public announcement without our prior written consent​. (However, stating that you sell on Symspace in product packaging or on your website in a factual manner is generally fine – e.g., “Available on Symspace” – but anything that implies a special endorsement needs approval.)</p><h3>12.12. Affiliate Marketing</h3><p>If you engage in any affiliate marketing or advertising your Symspace listings via third parties, ensure compliance with advertising laws (truth-in-advertising, no spam, etc.). This Agreement doesn’t specifically cover an affiliate program (Symspace might have its own to drive traffic, separate from you).</p><p>By clicking “I Agree” or listing a product, you confirm that you have read this Symspace Seller Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions. We welcome you as a partner in the Symspace marketplace and look forward to a successful relationship.</p><p>Thank you for partnering with Symspace!
