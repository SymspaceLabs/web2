        question: "terms of use", 
        answer:"<h3>Last Updated: March 21, 2025</h3><br/><h3>1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</h3><p>Welcome to Symspace, an AI-driven 3D modeling and augmented reality (AR) marketplace platform. These Terms of Use ('Terms') govern your access to and use of the Symspace websites, mobile applications, Unity SDK components, and related services (collectively, the 'Symspace Platform' or 'Services'). By accessing or using the Symspace Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy, Buyer Agreement, and Seller Agreement (if applicable). If you do not agree, you must not use the Symspace Platform.</p><br/><h3>2. Definitions</h3><p>For purposes of these Terms:</p><ul><li><strong>'Symspace'</strong> (also 'we,' 'us,' or 'our') refers to Symspace Labs, Inc. and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and partner organizations.</li><li><strong>'Symspace Platform'</strong> refers to any Symspace websites ('Sites'), mobile apps ('Apps'), Unity SDK or AR components, AI tools, chatbots, and related services we provide.</li><li><strong>'User'</strong> (also 'you' or 'your') refers to any person or entity accessing or using the Symspace Platform, including buyers, sellers, and other visitors.</li><li><strong>'Content'</strong> includes all information, text, graphics, 3D models, images, video, audio, software, code, and other material on the Symspace Platform.</li><li><strong>'AI Tools'</strong> refers to Symspace's generative artificial intelligence features, such as AI-driven 3D model generation or chatbot assistants.</li><li><strong>'AR Features'</strong> refers to augmented reality functionalities in the Symspace Platform that allow visualization of Content.</li></ul><br/><h3>3. Use of the Symspace Platform</h3><h4>3.1. Eligibility</h4><p>You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction) to create an account or use the Services.</p><h4>3.2. Account Registration</h4><p>To access certain features (such as purchasing or selling), you may need to create an account. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration.</p><h4>3.3. License to Use</h4><p>Symspace grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Symspace Platform for its intended purposes.</p><h4>3.4. Prohibited Activities</h4><p>You agree NOT to engage in any of the following when using the Symspace Platform:</p><ul><li>Violating Laws: Using the Platform for illegal purposes or in violation of regulations.</li><li>Unauthorized Access: Attempting to access unauthorized accounts or data.</li><li>Interference: Disrupting or interfering with the operation of the Platform.</li><li>Data Scraping: Using bots or automated tools to extract data.</li><li>Inappropriate Content: Uploading unlawful, defamatory, or misleading content.</li></ul><br/><h3>4. Content and Intellectual Property</h3><h4>4.1. Ownership of Symspace Content</h4><p>Symspace or its licensors own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Symspace Content and the overall Symspace Platform.</p><h4>4.2. User Content License</h4><p>By submitting or posting User Content on Symspace, you grant Symspace a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use your content for operating, providing, and promoting the Symspace Platform and Services.</p><h4>4.3. Your Warranties for Content</h4><p>You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to the User Content you upload or provide.</p><h4>4.4. Symspace's AI-Generated Content</h4><p>Symspace's AI Tools may generate content such as 3D models, images, descriptions, or chatbot responses based on user inputs.</p><p>More sections can be added based on the complete Terms of Use document.</p><h4>4.4. Symspace’s AI-Generated Content</h4><p>Symspace’s AI Tools may generate content such as 3D models, images, descriptions, or chatbot responses (“AI Outputs”) based on user inputs (e.g., photos, scans, or prompts). You acknowledge that AI Outputs are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind​. While we strive for useful and accurate AI Outputs, these are computer-generated and may not be perfect or fully reliable. AI Outputs might be approximations or interpretations of the input and could include inaccuracies or elements from public data. Symspace does not guarantee the quality, accuracy, or originality of AI-generated content. Users are responsible for reviewing and verifying any AI Outputs before use (for example, a seller should review an AI-generated 3D model or description for their product to ensure it is correct). If you have rights in the input you provided (e.g., you uploaded a photo you own), you retain those rights; the AI Output may be considered a derivative work or new work product to which Symspace may claim rights as the creator of the AI process. Symspace grants you a license to use any AI Output we generate for you, for the purpose it was provided (e.g., a 3D model for you to use or a chatbot answer for your personal information), but you may not use AI Outputs to compete with Symspace or outside the scope of the Services without permission.</p><h4>4.5. Feedback</h4><p>If you provide Symspace with any suggestions, ideas, bug reports, or other feedback about the Platform (“Feedback”), you agree that Symspace is free to use or not use such Feedback for any purpose, without any obligation to you. Any use of Feedback will be without compensation or credit to you and will be owned by Symspace.</p><h4>4.6. Content Moderation</h4><p>Symspace may monitor, screen, remove, or edit User Content at our discretion, but we are not obligated to do so. We may remove or disable content that violates these Terms, infringes intellectual property, is alleged to infringe, or is otherwise objectionable. We may also suspend or terminate the accounts of users who repeatedly violate intellectual property rights or these Terms. Symspace assumes no responsibility or liability for any User Content, and you agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage arising from removal of any content or from the failure to remove any content.</p><h4>4.7. Permission for Personal Use</h4><p>You are allowed to access, view, and print Content from the Symspace Platform for your personal and non-commercial use only. For example, a buyer may view 3D models and product information for the purpose of evaluating a purchase, and may use the AR Features to visualize a product in their space for personal use. Except as explicitly permitted, you may not use any part of the Platform or its content for commercial purposes without express permission​. You also may not use Symspace’s trademarks or branding without prior written consent. If you wish to use any content from the Platform beyond what is permitted by these Terms or by law, you must obtain written permission from Symspace or the relevant rights holder.</p><br/><h3>5. Special Terms for AR and AI Features</h3><h4>5.1. Augmented Reality (AR) Features</h4><p>Symspace’s AR features allow you to overlay digital 3D models (such as product images or virtual items) onto your real-world environment through your device’s camera. While we aim to provide true-to-size visualizations to help you see how products fit and look in context​, we do not guarantee that AR representations are perfectly accurate or to scale in all circumstances. Variations in device sensors, user calibration, lighting, and other conditions mean that the size, color, and appearance of products in AR may differ slightly from the actual product. AR visualizations are for informational and illustrative purposes only; they are not a substitute for physically inspecting dimensions or other characteristics. Always double-check critical details (like measurements or colors) through product descriptions or by contacting the seller.</p><h4>5.2. Safety and Awareness</h4><p>When using AR Features, you must exercise caution and remain aware of your surroundings, as hazards may exist in your environment that are not visible through the AR display​. Do not use the AR Features in dangerous locations or situations (for example, near stairs, traffic, or while driving). Symspace is not responsible for any injuries, accidents, or damage that may occur while you are using AR Features. You assume all risk for any such activities. Always ensure you have a safe area to use AR and stop using it if you experience any discomfort (such as dizziness or disorientation) or become aware of a hazard.</p><h4>5.3. Generative AI and Chatbots</h4><p>Symspace may provide AI-driven features like chatbots to answer questions or generative tools to create content (like 3D models or style recommendations). These AI features are experimental and meant to enhance your experience, but they may produce incorrect or unexpected results. For example, a chatbot’s response about a product or an AI-generated style suggestion might not be fully accurate or suitable to your situation. You should not rely solely on AI outputs for important decisions, and you understand that any recommendations or content from AI are provided without any guarantee. Symspace is not responsible for actions you take based on AI-provided information. If you spot an error in an AI output, please let us know so we can improve the system. We reserve the right to modify or restrict the use of AI features at any time.</p><h4>5.4. Third-Party Tools (Unity SDK & Others)</h4><p>Our App integrates the Unity SDK and possibly other third-party AR frameworks (such as ARKit for iOS or ARCore for Android) to power AR experiences. By using our App, you also agree to the necessary third-party software terms to the extent they apply. Symspace has no control over those underlying frameworks. We provide our AR and AI features “as is” and as available, and we disclaim any warranties or liability for issues attributable to third-party components. If the Unity SDK or other third-party service causes a crash or error, we will work to resolve it, but we are not liable for any losses arising from such issues.</p><br/><h2>6. Privacy</h2><p>Your privacy is important to us. Our <a href='#'>Privacy Policy</a> (linked here and incorporated by reference) explains how we collect, use, and share your personal information when you use the Symspace Platform. By using the Services, you consent to the collection and use of information as outlined in the Privacy Policy. Key points include: data we collect (like account info, usage data, AR scan data, cookies), how we use it (to provide and improve services, facilitate transactions, etc.), and how we share it (with sellers for fulfilling orders, with service providers, etc.). Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. If you have questions about our data practices, you can contact us at the information provided in the Privacy Policy.</p><br/><h2>7. Links to Third-Party Sites</h2><p>The Symspace Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources that are not owned or controlled by Symspace (for example, a link to a brand’s site, or an external documentation for Unity or AI services). These links are provided for your convenience only. Symspace does not endorse any third-party sites or their content. You acknowledge that Symspace has no responsibility for the availability, accuracy, or content of such external sites or resources. If you access a third-party website from our Platform, you do so at your own risk, and your use of those sites will be subject to the third party’s terms and policies.</p><br/><h2>8. Affiliate and Partner Disclaimer</h2><p>Symspace works with various affiliate organizations, sponsors, and promotional partners (for example, organizations advocating for accessibility, or technology partners). These entities are collectively included as part of the “Symspace Parties” protected by certain provisions of these Terms. No affiliate or partner of Symspace shall have any liability to users under these Terms. Any claim or dispute arising from your use of the Platform shall only be brought against Symspace, not against its affiliates, shareholders, officers, employees, or partner organizations. You agree that you will not involve Symspace’s affiliates or partners in any legal dispute you may have with Symspace or other users of the Platform.</p><br/><h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2><p><strong>THE SYMSPACE PLATFORM AND ALL CONTENT, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH IT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND</strong>, either express or implied. Symspace disclaims all warranties, express, implied, or statutory, regarding the Platform and any products or content obtained through the Platform, including but not limited to any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, accuracy, or non-infringement.</p><ul><li><strong>Platform Performance:</strong> We do not guarantee that the Symspace Platform will be uninterrupted, secure, or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components.</li><li><strong>Content Accuracy:</strong> Symspace does not warrant that product descriptions, pricing, availability, or other content provided by sellers or other third parties on the Platform are accurate, complete, or reliable.</li><li><strong>AR/AI Outputs:</strong> We make no warranty that AR visualizations or AI Outputs will meet your expectations or requirements.</li><li><strong>Quality of Products:</strong> Symspace is not the manufacturer or provider of the products sold by third-party sellers on the Platform.</li></ul><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties, so some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you. In such case, our warranties are limited to the minimum scope permitted by law.</p><br/><h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2><p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW</strong>, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY OF THE SYMSPACE PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.</p><p>Additionally, the total aggregate liability of the Symspace Parties for any claim arising out of these Terms or the Symspace Platform is limited to the greater of:</p><ul><li>The amount you have paid to Symspace in the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the liability.</li><li>USD $100.</li></ul><p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for certain damages; in those jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the smallest amount permitted by law.</p><br/><h2>11. Indemnification</h2><p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Symspace and the Symspace Parties from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in any way connected with:</p><ul><li>Your access to or use of the Symspace Platform.</li><li>Your breach of these Terms.</li><li>Any third-party claim alleging that content you provided infringes intellectual property rights.</li><li>Your violation of any law or the rights of any third party.</li></ul><p>Symspace reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you.</p><br/><h2>12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2><h3>12.1. Governing Law</h3><p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p><h3>12.2. Informal Resolution</h3><p>We encourage you to contact us first if you have any issue with Symspace. Often, customer service can resolve most concerns quickly. You can reach us at <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a>.</p><h3>12.3. Agreement to Arbitrate</h3><p>If we cannot resolve a dispute informally, you and Symspace agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis.</p><h3>12.4. Arbitration Procedure</h3><p>The arbitration will be administered by a reputable arbitration organization (such as AAA or JAMS) under its rules for consumer disputes.</p><h3>12.5. Class Action Waiver</h3><p>You and Symspace agree that any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.</p><h3>12.6. Opt-Out</h3><p>You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending a written notice to <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.com'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> within 30 days of first accepting these Terms.</p><h2>12.7. Exceptions</h2><p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing in these Terms will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights. Such an action may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Delaware or in your resident jurisdiction, at the filing party’s choice.</p><h2>12.8. Jurisdiction and Venue</h2><p>To the extent any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms (for example, if you opt out of arbitration or to enforce an arbitration award or seek injunctive relief), you and Symspace consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware. You waive any objections to such jurisdiction or venue, including objections based on inconvenience.</p><br/><h2>13. Termination</h2><h3>13.1. By You</h3><p>You may stop using the Symspace Platform at any time. You may also delete your account by following the instructions on the Platform or contacting customer support. Deleting your account will terminate your ability to log in, but these Terms (and any other agreements you have entered into, such as a Buyer or Seller Agreement) will continue to apply to your past use and any outstanding obligations.</p><h3>13.2. By Symspace</h3><p>We may suspend or terminate your account or your access to all or part of the Platform at any time, with or without notice, for any reason including, but not limited to, if we believe: (a) you have violated these Terms or any other agreement with Symspace; (b) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (c) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such termination or suspension, but we may terminate immediately in some cases (for example, a serious violation or fraud).</p><h3>13.3. Effect of Termination</h3><p>Upon termination of your account, whether by you or us, your right to use the Symspace Platform ceases immediately. However, certain provisions of these Terms will survive termination. These include sections relating to Intellectual Property (Section 4), Disclaimers (Section 9), Limitation of Liability (Section 10), Indemnification (Section 11), Dispute Resolution (Section 12), and any other provision that by its nature should survive termination.</p><h3>13.4. Data on Termination</h3><p>If your account is terminated, we may permanently delete your User Content from our Platform, including any 3D models or listing information you provided, without liability to you. However, content that you have made public or shared with others (for example, reviews or comments) may still be accessible by others if it has been cached or re-shared. Symspace is not liable for any damages following account termination, including for loss of data. We recommend that sellers maintain backup copies of any content or data they upload to the Platform.</p><br/><h2>14. Miscellaneous</h2><h3>14.1. Entire Agreement</h3><p>These Terms (together with the Privacy Policy, Buyer Agreement, Seller Agreement, and any additional guidelines or policies posted on the Platform) constitute the entire agreement between you and Symspace regarding your use of the Platform. They supersede any prior agreements or communications between you and us relating to the subject matter. In case of a conflict between these Terms and any other policy or agreement, the specific terms of that policy or agreement will govern with respect to the services or subject matter it addresses (for example, the Seller Agreement will govern matters specific to sellers).</p><h3>14.2. Severability</h3><p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision will be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to remedy the invalidity while preserving the original intent.</p><h3>14.3. No Waiver</h3><p>Symspace’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Symspace.</p><h3>14.4. Assignment</h3><p>You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. Any attempted assignment without consent is void. Symspace may freely assign or transfer these Terms (in whole or in part) as part of a corporate reorganization, merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise. These Terms shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors, and permitted assigns.</p><h3>14.5. No Agency</h3><p>No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Symspace as a result of these Terms or your use of the Platform. You do not have any authority to bind Symspace in any respect.</p><h3>14.6. Notices</h3><p>Symspace may provide notices to you by email to the address associated with your account, by postal mail, or via postings on the Platform. Notices will be deemed given as of the date they are sent or posted. You are responsible for keeping your contact information up to date. You may provide notices to Symspace by email at <a href='mailto:contact@symspacelabs.'>contact@symspacelabs.com</a> or by written communication to Symspace Labs, Inc., [address].</p><h3>14.7. Force Majeure</h3><p>Symspace will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform as required by these Terms because of any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, governmental actions, internet or utility failures, or any other cause beyond our control.</p><p>By using the Symspace Platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms of Use.
